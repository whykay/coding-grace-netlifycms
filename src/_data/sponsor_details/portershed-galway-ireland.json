We are driven by a need to combine the economic, physical and networking assets in the West of Ireland to optimise the potential of Galway as a place to live and work. Our ethos is to support this growth by accelerating the potential of startups in Galway with a shared vision for our community.\r\n\r\nPorterShed is the first building in the Galway City Innovation District (GCID). Our vision is to build an innovation district in the heart of Galway City. We plan to continue the momentum and in 2018 open a second building in the GCID ecosystem."
