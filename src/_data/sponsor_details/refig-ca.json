Composed of an international collective of scholars, community organizers and industry representatives, ReFiG is committed to promoting diversity and equity in the game industry and culture and effecting real change in a space that has been exclusionary to so many. We can (and will) do this by intervening in 4 areas: game cultures, the games industry, informal learning environments (e.g. community-based incubators), and formal education (e.g. degree and certificate programs in game studies and game design)."
