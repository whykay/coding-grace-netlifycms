  "blurb": "We are a volunteer run project that exists to help local game developers both inside and outside of the industry to network, communicate and publicise their work. We also provide a range of resources, including research and reports on the local industry. Launched in 2003, in 2014 the site was redesigned to take audiovisual content and integrate with social media. You are now visiting version 3 of the site, which is still in development."
