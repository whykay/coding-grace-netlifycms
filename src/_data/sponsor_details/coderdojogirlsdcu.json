The true power of the net comes from coding, designing and having fun. CoderDojo is a place where you can learn from others and share what you are doing! Each week we have a hands on session with technologies like HTML5, App Development, PHP or Python.\r\n\r\nAt CoderDojoDCU we provide a class where girls will definitely not be outnumbered, the content is more fun for girls and the mentors are also majority female (you\u2019ll find the odd one with a deeper voice and a dodgy wig ;) )"
