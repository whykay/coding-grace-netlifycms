Students use their academic training in media studies at NUIM to make art, to engage with media industries, to purse research in academia, and to make policy.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe study of media is a wide-ranging activity; the development of media channels, technologies and systems is wrapped up in the development of the societies we currently live in and how we live in them.\r\n\r\nMedia Studies examines how mediated communication works through language and images, through particular technologies organised in political and economic systems, and for audiences that can be part of a shared public that lives with and uses media forms in diverse ways. Any one of these areas can form the basis for deep questioning and research, yet it is rare that one area can be \u2013 or should be \u2013 considered in isolation from the others.\r\n\r\nAt NUIM we offer degree programmes in Media Studies and Digital Media at both a graduate and postgraduate level."
