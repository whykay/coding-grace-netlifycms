The group has a broad scope, covering issues from cloud to mobile and everything in between; while the group does have some bias towards the many innovative technologies developed by Google, the group is generally very open - this manifests in terms of interest in alternative and complementary technologies to those offered by Google, technologies which are not Google specific (eg HTML5) and engaging with other companies."
