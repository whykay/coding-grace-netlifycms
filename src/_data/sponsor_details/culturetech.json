  "blurb": "A quirky, intimate and unique gathering of speakers, artists, performers and industry professionals from digital media, technology, music and the arts.\r\n\r\n### And now for something completely different\r\nHeld across a big messy week in derry-londonderry, n. Ireland \u2013 the inaugural uk city of culture \u2013 and featuring over separate 100 events and sessions, culturetech is a unique celebration at the crossroads of arts, culture and technology. It\u02bcs a gathering of interesting people \u2013 doing interesting things \u2013 who all want to learn, share and have a blast. If that isn\u02bct enough of a reason to come, here\u02bcs four more.\r\n\r\n### Cool people in small places.\r\nWe don\u02bct really do big and \ufb02ashy. We\u02bcd rather bring dozens of exciting artists, performers and industry pros from across the world and put them in coffee shops, bars, restaurants, historic buildings and unloved retail spaces throughout the city centre \u2013 so you can actually meet and spend time with them.\r\n\r\n### A proper city festival\r\nNo, not the wellies in a \ufb01eld kind of festival, but de\ufb01nitely the live gigs throughout the city, nightly label showcases in cool venues, interesting \ufb01lm screenings, boundarypushing dramatic performances, digital art exhibitions, casual video gaming arcades and family-friendly events kind.\r\n\r\n### Business as unusual\r\nWe don\u02bct really do formal either. This is a jeans and t-shirts kind of event. Yes, there\u02bcs business to be done with hundreds of industry delegates and speakers coming from across the uk, ireland and beyond. And we can just about guarantee you\u02bcll learn something too. But if you\u02bcre here for business, expect to do it while listening to an exciting new band. \r\n\r\n### \u201cpay what it's worth\u201d ticketing\r\nAnd we certainly don\u02bct do pricey. Culturetech is meant to be accessible for all. A big chunk of the programme is completely free and open to the public. Where there is a cost, it\u02bcs normally just a few pounds or (if you get your ticket early) based on a \u201cpay what it's worth\u201d model. In short, we want everyone to come, get involved and have a great time\r\n"
