We meet monthly and together we'll figure out how to rewire our brains to think and code functionally.\r\n\r\nFunctional Kats started in January 2014 and has been going since, follow @functionalKats on twitter to learn more about stuff :D\r\n\r\nMeetups generally begin with a programming challenge. You are encouraged to solve the problem in any language, ideally in collaboration with other attendees. After a break for some refreshments project a selection of the solutions on to the big screen for discussion.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time we change the format to more of a talk/workshop, given by either a member of the group, or an outside speaker. We try to ensure that talks are tailored to allow for some element of hands on coding.",
