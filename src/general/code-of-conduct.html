            <p>Coding Grace is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
            <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any events venue, including talks. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Coding Grace events. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event without a refund (if any) at the sole discretion of the event organisers.</p>
            <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>

              <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

              <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

              <p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
              <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for Coding Grace.</p>
              <p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund (if any).</p>

              </h2>
              <p>
                This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative‚Äôs guide titled ‚Äú<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">Conference anti-harassment / Responding to Reports</a>‚Äù.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Staff will also be prepared to handle the incident. All of our staff are informed of the code of conduct policy and guide for handling harassment at the events.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a events staff member. All reports are confidential. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the staff have had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection as it is the other attendees.</p>
                  <p>When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available but do not interview people about the incident. Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.</p>
                  <p>
                    The important information consists of:

                    <ol>
                      <li >Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant doing the harassing</li>
                      <li>The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)</li>
                      <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
                      <li>Other people involved in the incident</li>
                    </ol>
                    The staff is well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim‚Äôs request. If you do feel your safety in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact the Garda√≠ by dialing 112. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any hotel phone or simply ask a staff member.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>Staff Procedure for incident handling
              </h3>
              <p>This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative‚Äôs guide titled ‚Äú<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports</a>‚Äù.</p>

              <h4>Try to get as much of the incident in written form by the reporter. If you cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you. The important information to gather include the following:
              </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant doing the harassing</li>
                <li>The behavior that was in violation</li>
                <li>The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)</li>
                <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
                <li>Other people involved in the incident</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Prepare an initial response to the incident. This initial response is very important and will set the tone for PyCon. Depending on the severity/details of the incident, please follow these guidelines.
              </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>If there is any general threat to attendees or the safety of anyone including conference staff is in doubt, summon security or Garda√≠</li>
                <li>Offer the victim a private place to sit</li>
                <li>Ask ‚Äúis there a friend or trusted person who you would like to be with you?‚Äù (if so, arrange for someone to fetch this person)</li>
                <li>Ask them ‚Äúhow can I help?‚Äù</li>
                <li>Provide them with your list of emergency contacts if they need help later</li>
                <li>If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim‚Äôs request</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre OK with it [pursuing the complaint]‚Äù suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.</li>
                <li>Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff responsibility.</li>
                <li>Do not offer them input into penalties. This is the staff‚Äôs responsibility.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Once something is reported to a staff member, immediately meet with the conference chair and/or event coordinator. The main objectives of this meeting is to find out the following:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>What happened?</li>
                <li>Are we doing anything about it?</li>
                <li>Who is doing those things?</li>
                <li>When are they doing them?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-6 prose prose-indigo prose-lg text-gray-500 lg:mt-0">
              <h4 class="pt-44">Some things for the staff to consider when dealing with Code of Conduct offenders:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions</li>
                <li>Requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event</li>
                <li>Ending a talk that violates the policy early</li>
                <li>Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy</li>
                <li>Not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event now or in the future</li>
                <li>Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds</li>
                <li>Requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future events your organization runs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)</li>
                <li>Requiring that the harasser refund any travel grants and similar they received (this would need to be a condition of the grant at the time of being awarded)</li>
                <li>Requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return</li>
                <li>Banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)</li>
                <li>Removing a harasser from membership of relevant organisations</li>
                <li>Publishing an account of the harassment and calling for the resignation of the harasser from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called for if the harasser is the event leader, or refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest, or similar, typically event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this isn‚Äôt as useful)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Give accused attendees a place to appeal to if there is one, but in the meantime the report stands. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to encourage an apology from the harasser.
              </p>

              <p>It is very important how we deal with the incident publicly. Our policy is to make sure that everyone aware of the initial incident is also made aware that it is not according to policy and that official action has been taken - while still respecting the privacy of individual attendees. When speaking to individuals (those who are aware of the incident, but were not involved with the incident) about the incident it is a good idea to keep the details out.</p>

              <p>Depending on the incident, the conference chair, or designate, may decide to make one or more public announcements. If necessary, this will be done with a short announcement either during the plenary and/or through other channels. No one other than the conference chair or someone delegated authority from the conference chair should make any announcements. No personal information about either party will be disclosed as part of this process.</p>

              <p>If some attendees were angered by the incident, it is best to apologize to them that the incident occurred to begin with. If there are residual hard feelings, suggest to them to write an email to the conference chair or to the event coordinator. It will be dealt with accordingly.</p>
