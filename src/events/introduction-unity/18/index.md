<h2>Pre-reqs</h2>
<p>You will need a laptop with latest Unity installed (Mac or Windows). Download via&nbsp;<a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/download" title="Download Unity">http://unity3d.com/unity/download</a>.</p>
<p>If you have 2d art, sounds, music or 3d models they can bring them along and use them in the workshop</p>
