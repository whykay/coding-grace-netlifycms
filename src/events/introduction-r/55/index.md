R is one of the most widely used programming language in the arena of analytics, data mining and data science. It's open source and cross-platform, giving you freedom of when and where you use it. It's has 2000+ freely available libraries for a wide range of task such as: 

* connecting to databases,
* cleaning and processing data, 
* plotting, 
* linear and non-linear modelling,
* clustering, and 
* machine learning

to name a few. On top of this, it is supported, developed and used daily by a vast community of people and companies. For those new to programming, it is easy to learn the basics, and for those of you who have programmed for years, it is another programming tool to add to your repertoire.

Want to learn R? Come along to try out R and to discover for yourself why it is so popular. Our workshop will introduce you to the world of R in a fun and interactive way. Whether you are new to programming or an experienced programmer, this workshop will be of benefit to you.
