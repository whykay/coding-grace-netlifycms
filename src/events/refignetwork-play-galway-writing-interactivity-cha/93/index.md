This diversity-friendly workshop is the first part of a series of beginners workshops.

**Description:** <br>
Note: Places are limited to 15 people.

Learn how to write interactive narrative in a step-by-step, hands-on session. First, I'll talk about the history of interactive narrative and the practice of writing for video games, including the theory of structuring narratives for choice and interactivity,. Then, we'll work through a series of writing exercises and paper prototypes for understanding branching narrative. Finally, I'll show you how to use a free and easy tool called Twine to craft and publish your interactive narratives!
