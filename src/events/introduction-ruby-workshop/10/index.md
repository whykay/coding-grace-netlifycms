## Pre-reqs

Make sure you have Ruby installed.
<ul><li><span>Linux (should be there by default)</span></li>
<li><span>Mac (it is there by default. v2 in Mavericks, r</span><span>1.8.7-p358 in Mountain Lion</span><span>). If it&#8217;s not then get installer via </span><a href="http://railsinstaller.org/en">http://railsinstaller.org/en</a><span><br/></span></li>
<li>Windows (<a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">http://rubyinstaller.org/</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Linux/Mac, if you run the following:</h3>

<blockquote>
ruby -v
</blockquote>

It should come back with something like

<blockquote>
ruby 1.9.3p327  (2012-11-10 revision 37606)
</blockquote>

<p>If this is returned</p>
<blockquote>
-bash: ruby: command not found
</blockquote>

Then you need to install Ruby.

<h3>Windows</h3>
If you haven&#8217;t installed Ruby before on Windows, go to <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">http://rubyinstaller.org/</a>.
