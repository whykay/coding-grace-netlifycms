As part of Women Techmakers: Google, GDG Dublin has invited Coding Grace to run a 2 hour introduction to Python workshop. 

Some information:

For this month meeting we will have 2 tracks: Women Techmakers and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/events/google-cloud-platform-live/).
We will have talks on Google Cloud Platform as part of Google Cloud Platform Live and we will have free introduction workshops (mainly for women) in association with Coding Grace on Python and HTML/CSS as part of [womentechmakers.com](http://womentechmakers.com/). By bringing the 2 events together, our aim is to have gender parity.  

Please note that you need to have a ticket for the event but you also one for the workshop you would like to attend and, obviously, you cannot attend both workshops.
