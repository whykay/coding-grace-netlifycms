Coding Grace along with GameCraft are delighted to partner with Meath Partnership on this [Erasmus+ programme](https://cybervet.eu/) hosting an Irish Cybersecurity Game Jam

The main objective of the project is to strengthen the European VET capacity to recognise and manage cybersecurity threats (e. g. phishing attacks, botnets, financial and banking frauds, data fraud et.).

The project will help to improve the skills of VET educators in relation to management of cybersecurity threats, which is very important especially considering their central role in the knowledge transfer of good practices and skills to their students.  Last but not at least, this project will also help to increase the awareness of teachers, students and their families about the importance to recognise such daily risks, which can have both economic and social impact. 

Games developed during the Gamejam will be included in the Cybersecurity Awareness Training material developed

### 🤔 FAQ
#### But what is a game jam?

A game jam is an event for people to make games based on a theme (announced at the beginning of the jam) within a given period of time. It can be 8 hours or even up to 24 hours.

#### What tools can I use?

You use your own tools, laptops, sound equipment, peripherals, software, assets, etc. 

#### Am I able for a game jam?

YES! You like games, and having fun. You don’t have to be a programmer, if you can draw, tell stories, make music, and more… come along! We need more designers, crafters and makers!

#### What if I never made a game before?

You can use a beginner-friendly game making tool like like [Twine](https://twinery.org/) where you create interactive stories that you can share and play online - perfect for uploading to itchio.

Another one is FlatGameMaker, a plugin for Unity and also beginner-friendly: <https://dreamfeel.itch.io/flatgame>

Both of these tools are beginner-friendly.

#### Is there an age restriction to participate?

Yes,  this event is fo 18s and over.

#### Do I have to be in a team?

Nope, let us know when you check-in at registration on Saturday morning (08:30 till 08:59), and let us know what skills you have, and we can form a group in the morning before we announce the theme.

#### How many can we have in a team?

As many as you want, but more than 1, it's fun to work with a team of people.  😊

[GameCraft](https://gamecraft.it/) and [Coding Grace](https://codinggrace.com/) are external community partners helping with facilitating this game jam. Both are not-for-profit Irish initiatives promoting community events, sharing experiences in a friendly and inclusive environment.
