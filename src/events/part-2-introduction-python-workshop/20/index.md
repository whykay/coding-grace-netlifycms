  >Learn Python the Hard Way</a>&nbsp;before, I would recommend you yo step through\
  \ it as far as Chapter 10.\r\n\r\n### What do I need to bring?\r\n<p>Just your laptop.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n### Do I need to install anything?\r\n<p>Nope, a browser like Firefox or Chrome\

I'm happy to announce that our second workshop has been confirmed. Same location, same time, just a different day. ;-)

This is part 2 of our 3-parter workshop. We will be following on from Chapters 10 of <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>.
