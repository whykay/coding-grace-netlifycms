This December learn easy basics of coding with html at our first Coding Grace workshop in Wexford.

We aim to provide a support network for people from all backgrounds and hope our outreach will help bring those who are interested in code development together and learn from one another.

All you need to know is how to open / close files and type ( or how to use copy / paste ;-) ). 

For more info, please email: <a href="mailto:wexford@codinggrace.com">wexford@codinggrace.com</a>

This event is **FREE** but you must have a ticket, as we will have only a limited number of spaces available. 

Please ensure you also have a fully charged laptop with working wi-fi (Windows, Linux, Mac).
