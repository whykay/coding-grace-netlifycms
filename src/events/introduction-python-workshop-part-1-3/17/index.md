faq: "### What do I need to bring?\r\n\r\nJust your laptop.\r\n\r\n### Do I need to\
  \ install anything?\r\n\r\nNope, a browser like Firefox or Chrome would be grand.\r\
  \n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nWe will be very interactive in this workshop, using iPython\
  \ Notebook.\r\n\r\n### Why are you charging?\r\n\r\nTo cover things like pastries,\
  \ tea, biccies, and hopefully, a little surpise.\r\n\r\n### Is lunch included?\r\
  \n\r\nNo, but there is a local spar and a caf\xE9 across the road. Tis very convenient."
