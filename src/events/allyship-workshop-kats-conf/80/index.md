Kats Conf is delighted to announce Coding Grace and Workday are partnering together on an Allyship workshop. This event is open to everyone and is free to attend.

What does it mean to be an "ally"? Why do we need them?

We'll provide an overview of the principles on diversity and offer practical steps that can be taken to curb unconscious bias and be effective allies in the workplace.

### Schedule
* 17:30 Registration
* 18:00 Workshop starts
* 21:00 Workshop ends

# Call for facilitators
We are looking for facilitators to help with the group sessions. If interested, drop me an email at <a href="mailto:contact@codinggrace.com">contact@codinggrace.com</a>.

### Note for Facilitators
Facilitators should arrive at 16:30 for a briefing before the workshop starts.

We are using materials for the workshop from [Ada Initiative](https://adainitiative.org/continue-our-work/workshops-and-training/) (more updated version on [Frame Shift Consulting](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/ally-skills-workshop/)). You can find more information about being a facilitator via [Frame Shift Consulting Ally Skills Workshop Facilitators Guide](http://files.frameshiftconsulting.com/AllySkillsWorkshopFacilitatorsGuide.pdf).
