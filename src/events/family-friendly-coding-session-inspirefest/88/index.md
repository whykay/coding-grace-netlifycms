We are teaming up with [Coder Dojo](https://coderdojo.com/) to run a family-friendly coding session at Inspirefest Fringe on Saturday morning. The event is FREE but you need to register to attend.

Thanks to [Girls Hack Ireland](https://girlshackireland.org/) providing laptops, and [Silicon Republic](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/) for inviting us to run this event,

There will be a pick'n'mix of Python Turtle, Scratch and HTML coding fun to choose from.

Big thanks to the volunteers who are helping on the day, I will update the mentor list as I get information, and big thanks to Pete and Niambh for co-organising this event.
