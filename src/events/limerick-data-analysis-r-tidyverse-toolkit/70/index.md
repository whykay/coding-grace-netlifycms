Beginner friendly R workshop, introducing the tidyverse toolkit.

You will need to bring your laptop (and don't forget charger), and have the following installed:

* R - [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* RStudio - [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* For those using Macs, make sure you install XQuartz, this is a big download - [http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)

The workshop will  be broken down into four segments.

* Fundamentals of R : using the R environment, CRAN, working with R packages
* Data Manipulation with dplyr :
* Data Visualization with ggplot2 : 
* A crash course on R for Statistics: We might not get to spend too much time on this, but here we will look at running some straightforward statistical procedures with R: t-tests, variance tests, cluster analysis, testing normality etc

The materials will be on-line at [RWorkshop.github.io](http://rworkshop.github.io/).
