faq: "## About our Speakers\r\n### Christina Lynch / [@xtinalynch](https://twitter.com/xtinalynch)\r\
  \n\r\nChristina currently works as a Technical Support Engineer in Microsoft Ireland.\
  \ Christina is the organiser of Ireland Girl Geek Dinners. Girl Geek Dinners is\
  \ an informal organization that promotes the presence of women in the Information\
  \ technology industry.\r\n\r\n### Elizabeth Murphy\r\nI spot potential and build\
  \ great teams. I\u2019m an experienced technical recruiter and HR professional.\
  \ I\u2019ve scaled teams in companies including Mobile Travel Technologies, Version\
  \ 1, Ernst & Young etc.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve hired people in Java, .Net, iOS, Android,\
  \ PHP, DevOps, Test, Product & Project Management, and every function in between.\
  \  (even did Symbian way back in the day!) \r\n\r\nI really LOVE technology. More\
  \ importantly I take the time to really understand what technical stack or I\u2019\
  m hiring for.\r\n\r\nWith me, every single CV gets a response (it\u2019s the least\
  \ you deserve). You\u2019re kept in the loop every step of the way, and if you ask\
  \ me for feedback, you get it. (No such thing as \u201Cdo not reply\u201De-mails\
  \ with me).\r\n\r\nIn my spare time, I\u2019m interested in VR, CyberPsychology,\
  \ and supporting Women in Tech. \r\n\r\n### Sorcha Bowler / [@saoili](https://twitter.com/saoili)\r\
  \n\r\nSorcha wrote her first program in BASIC around the age of eight. Her father\
  \ and all three of her older siblings are coders, so it made sense to her to do\
  \ the same. She wrote a little Logo in school, but otherwise didn't get to do much\
  \ more coding before she studied computer science in college, writing C++ and Java\
  \ mostly. After college she got a QA job where she was told she'd be able to move\
  \ into a programming job, but that never happened. She left after a year and spent\
  \ nearly a decade in a service and support role. In her last couple of years there\
  \ she was doing a job that involved suggesting improvements to customer code. Thus\
  \ realising that she missed writing code, and on her excellent brother in law's\
  \ advice, she taught herself Python. She fell in love with its simplicity and grace\
  \ and lost the ability to write pysdo-code, as it now just comes out as Python when\
  \ she tries. She got involved in Coding Grace, mentoring beginner programmers. After\
  \ she interviewed in several different companies, learning something each time,\
  \ the good people at Betbright gave her a chance and hired her. She's been working\
  \ there as a developer for over three years now and is still delighted with herself.\r\
  \n\r\n### Sarah Doran / [@sarahd0ran](https://twitter.com/sarahd0ran)\r\n\r\nSoftware\
  \ Development Manager at Travelport Digital with 12 years experience. Ask me about\
  \ Java, Web and Mobile development, Tech lead and Development manager roles. Outside\
  \ of work you'll find me organising Coderdojo Coolest Projects and helping with\
  \ CoderDojoGirls events.\r\n\r\nFun fact: I once jumped out of a helicopter at 12,000ft\r\
  \n\r\n### Ingrid Epure / [@ingridepure](https://twitter.com/ingridepure)\r\n\r\n\
  Ingrid is an engineer currently working for Intercom in Dublin, Ireland. She has\
  \ been coding for more than 12 years and discovered her passion for distributed\
  \ systems and infrastructure 3 years ago. She is a conference speaker, an active\
  \ member in the Python community and loves mentoring and helping with community-driven\
  \ events.\r\n\r\n## About weAREhere\r\nweAREhere are a collective of diversity-friendly\
