A big thanks to [Dogpatch Labs](http://dogpatchlabs.com) for hosting our event and [Digit Games Studio](https://www.digitgaming.com/) for sponsoring refreshments afterwards.

# Speakers (in alphabetical order)

## Jen Carey
Jen is a Dublin based game maker with a background in development, writing and acting. After leaving college she worked in a number of companies, most recently at the Irish middleware company Havok, as a Quality Assurance Engineer. 
Towards the end of last year she took the dive into independent development and is working on a number of projects. Some of which will be finished soon, others... let's not talk about them.
In her talk she will be explaining a bit about the place of QA in the industry, what the job is like and where it can lead. 
You can find her [@jen_carey_](https://twitter.com/jen_carey_) on twitter or check out [www.ficklegames.com](http://www.ficklegames.com)

## Tracey McCabe
One cold and miserable January morning, Tracey decided to pack in her old life and take her ten years of development experience into games and on the road. Since then she's been travelling and remotely developing. Tracey is lead programmer with Spooky Doorway, an Irish indie games studio, currently developing [The Darkside Detective](http://darksidedetective.com/), a micro-adventure game being developed for PC and consoles in which you help Detective Francis McQueen investigate bizarre bite-sized cases. In her talk, she will give you an overview of how one of these cases is put together, start to finish.

You can follow her nonsense at [spiderwinkle.com](http://spiderwinkle.com) and [@FarrellyTracey](https://twitter.com/FarrellyTracey).


## Anne-Sophie Mongeau
Anne-Sophie has been working on game audio with independent videogame studios since 2012, both designing and integrating sound. Her background in music and sound studies (Master's degree in Sound Design from the University of Edinburgh) has led her to be involved in projects of many different natures, including short films, animations, documentaries as well as interactive audio visual installations. She is now working as game audio engineer on a AAA title at Digit Games Studios. When Anne-Sophie is not sound designing, she can be found playing music, giving practical workshops and talks on game audio, or participating in experimental audio visual projects.

## Jas Panaich
Two years ago, Jas stumbled through the doorway of Live Operations at Riot Games and left the corporate suit behind. She's progressed as a Team Lead of Network Operations Center for a globally distributed team who strive to protect the total player experience. They get involved in a pinnacle aspect which all online games have in common; keeping live services alive to allow gamers to game all day, every day. She'll prop the door open to her world of Live Operations to share a gleam of what goes on behind the scenes of maintaining the health of a globally played game and how it unfolds when things go wrong.
