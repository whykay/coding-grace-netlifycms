faq: "#### Do I need to have coded before? \nNope! This workshop is for beginners. If you have a little knowledge, come along, but this is very much catered for those new to programming and interested in seeing what it is all about.

#### What do I need to bring? \nYour laptop - we expect you to bring your own laptop. This gives you a great opportunity to bring home what you work on and continue coding.

#### What do I need installed on my laptop before the event? \nIt will be useful to have Django installed in advance of the day. We will be emailing out information to registered attendees. And we will be hosting a time online before the event so as we can help anyone who needs it, get set up (this is optional).

#### Is this workshop for women only? \nAll genders can apply. We encourage a diverse community of programmers. This event is for 18 years + attendees.

#### Where is this workshop taking place? \nIn the Overstock Ireland Office. The address is: Westgate, Finisklin Business Park, Sligo, F91 HF66

#### Is there food provided? \nYes, there will be coffee, treats and lunch available for all attendees.

#### I have some questions about this event. Who can I contact? \naocallaghan@overstock.com
