We are delighted to announce a partnered event with Etsy Ireland on Allyship. This event is open to everyone and is free to attend.

What does it mean to be an "ally"? Why do we need them? Join Etsy's Toria Gibbs and Ian Malpass to learn about being an effective male ally to women in tech. We'll provide an overview of the principles of feminism and offer practical steps that can be taken to curb unconscious bias and be effective allies to women in the workplace.

If you want to register your interest, you can do so via [https://ti.to/etsy-ireland/being-an-effective-male-ally](https://ti.to/etsy-ireland/being-an-effective-male-ally).

# Call for facilitators
We are looking for facilitators to help with the group sessions. If interested, drop me an email at <a href="mailto:contact@codinggrace.com">contact@codinggrace.com</a>.

For facilitators, there will be a briefing session at 18:00 before the workshop starts.
