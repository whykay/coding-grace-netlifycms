The third part in our journey with<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learning Python The Hard Way</a>.

Before we delve any further, we will be going back a few chapters about file I/O and we will start using the PyCharm Editor instead of the awesome iPython Notebook we have been using in the last two workshops.

You have a choice to attend Part 3 on <strong>Monday evening</strong> or <strong>Saturday morning</strong>. Only difference is that on Monday evening, it&#8217;s a shorter session with no breaks.
