#### [UPDATE] Our introduction to Unity3D workshop will be rescheduled to November. Follow [@CodingGrace](https://twitter.com/codinggrace) for updates.

Become familiar with the biggest game engine of today - by making the biggest game of 1972! Electronic tennis took the world by storm on release - and it remains a modern classic!

Join us as we take a lightning-fast tour through the exciting features of the Unity3D engine (Pokemon GO, Firewatch, Crossy Road and more!), then rally around as we teach you the basics of game development, using electronic tennis as our blueprint! Beginners are welcome, and you'll end the day with a game to play with friends and family!

#### If you cannot attend the workshop, you register your interest via [https://ti.to/coding-grace/intro-to-unity3d-workshop](https://ti.to/coding-grace/intro-to-unity3d-workshop) and we will be in touch about future games-related workshops.
