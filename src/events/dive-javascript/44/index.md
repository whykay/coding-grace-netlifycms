Want to learn about Javascript? No programming background required to attend this diversity-friendly workshop mentored by David McMullin. 

Lunch will be included.

## Overview
10:45 Registration<br>
11:00 Welcome <br>
11:10 Workshop starts <br>
13:00 Lunch (included)  <br>
14:00 Workshop continues <br>
16:00 ENDS

We're going to work through some exercises from [http://nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/). It will help to have a few things installed on your machine but don't worry if you get stuck, we'll be starting the day by helping everyone get the required programs installed.

* Node and npm - helpful instructions [https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/wiki/Installation-suggestions](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/wiki/Installation-suggestions)
* If you don't have an editor, you can install Sublime Text Editor via [http://www.sublimetext.com/](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

After everyone's got their machines up and running, we'll work through the "javascripting" workshop together. This is installed by running `npm install -g javascripting`, we're happy to help with any installation problems on the day. Javascripting teaches JavaScript syntax and some commonly used patterns.

For attendees that finish javascripting, we recommend trying another workshop such as [learnyounode](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode) for learning about using NodeJS to execute JavaScript and common patterns there. The mentors are familiar with most workshops and can provide assistance as needed.
