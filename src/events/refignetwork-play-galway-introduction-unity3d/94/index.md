This diversity-friendly workshop is the third and final part of a series of beginners games workshops.

<strong>Description: </strong>In the workshop we will explore the basic building blocks needed to begin developing your own game in Unity. Using the engine's built in tools, you'll learn to create movement controls, set up platforms using colliders, wire up sprites for your character and enemies, set win/lose conditions and more.

Computers will be provided on the day, and spaces are limited to 14 persons.
