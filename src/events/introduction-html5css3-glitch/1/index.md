As part of /GLITCH festival at RUA RED we are running a workshop which will consist of 3 lessons presented by one of the mentors who will introduce students to the basic concepts of HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) with a emphasis on hands-on exercises. 

Students are encouraged to experiment and work with one another, and there are mentors at hand to answer any queries. In the end one will understand even a complicated looking web page,  and be able to debug and deconstruct web pages.

You will need to bring *your laptop*.

Lunch will be included.
