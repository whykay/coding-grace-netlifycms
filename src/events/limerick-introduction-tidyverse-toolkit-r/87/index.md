We are delighted to be back with another "Data Analysis with R : the tidyverse toolkit" workshop with Kevin O'Brien. Venue will be in UL. 

As this is a free event, lunch will **not** be included.

## Preparation

We will be use Azure notebooks for this workshop. No other installation is required. Just create an account at [notebooks.azure.com](https://notebooks.azure.com/).


The class will officially start at 10:30. For the first half hour, we will be preparing everyone. Please try to get set up as soon as possible. 

The workshop will be broken down into four segments.

* Fundamentals of R : using the R environment, CRAN, working with R packages
* Data Manipulation with dplyr 
* Data Visualization with ggplot2 
*  A crash course on R for Statistics: We might not get to spend too much time on this, but here we will look at running some straightforward statistical procedures with R: t-tests, variance tests, cluster analysis, testing normality etc
