A happy new year to everyone! What better way than to start your year learning about Raspberry Pi?

## What is Raspberry Pi?
The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. We want to see it being used by kids all over the world to learn programming. (via [Raspberry Pi website](http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs#introWhatIs))

Interested? Then sign up, if you bring your own Raspberry Pi, it will be cheaper. :-)

# DISCLAIMER
1.  You will be required to sign an NDA on arrival at Facebook office.
2.   None of the proceeds from ticket sales will be going to Facebook.

    * a) €35 ticket proceeds all contribute to the purchase of Raspberry Pi kit which includes a Raspberry Pi (Model B), Power Supply Unit, SD Card and HDMI cable.  If you are curious, consumer price for the kit will cost around €50.

    * b) €5 ticket proceeds will all go to Coding Grace to help run the workshop. 

3. If you borrowed a Facebook SD Card, this will be returned to Facebook when the workshop ends.
