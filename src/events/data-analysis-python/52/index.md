## Breakdown
The general breakdown (allowing for some other things to happen unexpectedly)

1. Setting yourself up and some Python essentials
2. a bit about numpy
3. stuff on pandas â€“ main part of the day
4. a quick example of something like clustering analysis (from scikit learn)

Lunch will be at 13:00.
