faq: "#### Is this event for women only? \nAll genders can apply. We encourage a diverse community of programmers. You are welcome to be a +1 as an ally supporting this event. 

#### ‚òïÔ∏è Why tea?
Pizzas and beer have been a staple of tech events, and why not discuss tech over a cup of tea?

As we build our Cup√°n Tae community, we aim to have more in-person conferences with tea-tasting and afternoon tea along with the talks and unconference sessions.

As part of our series, we will definitely recommend tea so you can join us and our speakers with a nice cuppa tea.

# Hang on, but what is Cup√°n Tae Conf?
Cup√°n Tae (/kup-awn tay/), or a cup of tea in Irish. Cup√°n Tae is a brand new experience of events by Coding Grace beginning with a series of virtual events where industry professionals will hear renowned speakers impart their experiences with opportunities to network over a ‚Äúcup of tea‚Äù. 

## Virtual events? Tell me more.
Cup√°n Tae will be taking place virtually.
Talks will be streamed to our Youtube channel (link will be shared with ticket holders).
Q&A and breakout sessions will take place on Coding Grace's Discord server.

### Each virtual talk event
* Guest speaker will give a talk for 1 hour.
* Participants freely break up into groups for networking and discussions for 1 hour

# The first series will consist of 3 virtual speaking events
#### Talk 1: "Path Dependence: History Matters" with Laura Nolan on Tuesday, 26th March 2024 (13:00 - 15:00)
* [https://cupantaeconf.com/path-dependence-history-matters](https://cupantaeconf.com/path-dependence-history-matters)


#### Talk 2: "Classic Vulnerabilities" with Patricia Aas on Tuesday, 7th May 2024 (18:00 - 20:00)
* [https://cupantaeconf.com/classic-vulnerabilities-by-patricia-aas](https://cupantaeconf.com/classic-vulnerabilities-by-patricia-aas/)

#### Talk 3 - Second System Effect - not a new problem by John Looney - April 4 (13:00 - 15:00)
* [https://cupantaeconf.com/second-system-effect-not-a-new-problem](https://cupantaeconf.com/second-system-effect-not-a-new-problem/)


##   Some principles (taken from DDD Open Spaces) for breakout sessions in both events
* Whoever comes are the right people. A session with two people can be as valuable as a session with ten.
* When it starts is the right time to start, and when it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over. And if it‚Äôs not over, make plans for continuing the conversation.
* Whatever happens is the only thing that could've happened.
* The Law of Two Feet: If you‚Äôre not getting value from a session, or not contributing value, feel free to go somewhere else. This way you can make the most of your time at the event.

# "Classic Vulnerabilities" by Patricia Aas
## Talk Description
We keep on thinking we are living in the future, but native exploitation has a rich history, and many times the vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques are decades old. We'll look at some of these, how they have surfaced in recent years and how prepared we are today, armed with modern tooling, to find and fix "classic" vulnerabilities.

### About Patricia Aas
Patricia is a programmer who has worked mostly in C++ and Java. She has spent her career continuously delivering from the same code-base to a large user base, from working on two browsers (Opera and Vivaldi), to working on embedded telepresence endpoints for Cisco. She is focused on the maintainability and flexibility of software architecture, and how to extend it to provide cutting edge user experiences.

Her focus on the end users has led her work more and more toward privacy and security, and she has recently started her own company, TurtleSec, hoping to contribute positively to the infosec and C++ communities. She is also involved in the #includeC++ organization hoping to improve diversity and inclusion in the C++ community.
