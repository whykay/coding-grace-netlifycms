faq: "#### Is this event for women only? \nAll genders can apply. We encourage a diverse community of programmers. You are welcome to be a +1 as an ally supporting this event. 

#### ☕️ Why tea?
Pizzas and beer have been a staple of tech events, and why not discuss tech over a cup of tea?

As we build our Cupán Tae community, we aim to have more in-person conferences with tea-tasting and afternoon tea along with the talks and unconference sessions.

As part of our series, we will definitely recommend tea so you can join us and our speakers with a nice cuppa tea.

# Hang on, but what is Cupán Tae Conf?
Cupán Tae (/kup-awn tay/), or a cup of tea in Irish. Cupán Tae is a brand new experience of events by Coding Grace beginning with a series of virtual events where industry professionals will hear renowned speakers impart their experiences with opportunities to network over a “cup of tea”. 

## Virtual events? Tell me more.
Cupán Tae will be taking place virtually.
Talks will be streamed to our Youtube channel (link will be shared with ticket holders).
Q&A and breakout sessions will take place on Coding Grace's Discord server.

### Each virtual talk event
* Guest speaker will give a talk for 1 hour.
* Participants freely break up into groups for networking and discussions for 1 hour

# The first series will consist of 3 virtual speaking events
#### Talk 1: "Path Dependence: History Matters" with Laura Nolan on Tuesday, 26th March 2024 (13:00 - 15:00)
* [https://cupantaeconf.com/path-dependence-history-matters](https://cupantaeconf.com/path-dependence-history-matters)


#### Talk 2: "Classic Vulnerabilities" with Patricia Aas on Tuesday, 7th May 2024 (18:00 - 20:00)
* [https://cupantaeconf.com/classic-vulnerabilities-by-patricia-aas](https://cupantaeconf.com/classic-vulnerabilities-by-patricia-aas/)

#### Talk 3 - Second System Effect - not a new problem by John Looney - April 4 (13:00 - 15:00)
* [https://cupantaeconf.com/second-system-effect-not-a-new-problem](https://cupantaeconf.com/second-system-effect-not-a-new-problem/)


##   Some principles (taken from DDD Open Spaces) for breakout sessions in both events
* Whoever comes are the right people. A session with two people can be as valuable as a session with ten.
* When it starts is the right time to start, and when it’s over, it’s over. And if it’s not over, make plans for continuing the conversation.
* Whatever happens is the only thing that could've happened.
* The Law of Two Feet: If you’re not getting value from a session, or not contributing value, feel free to go somewhere else. This way you can make the most of your time at the event.

# "Path Dependence: History Matters" with Laura Nolan
## Talk Description
The past affects what we are able to do in the present: it creates financial constraints, renders some technical choices feasible (or infeasible), and it shapes organisational cultures, which have significant inertia. Outcomes don’t depend only on current decisions and conditions - they also depend on past outcomes.

Path dependence is a concept from the social sciences, and it plays an important role in safety science. For example, sociologist Diane Vaughan explains the Challenger and Columbia accidents in terms of history: compromises made during the Shuttle program's initial planning stages which created difficult financial and technical constraints, and the organisation’s ‘can-do’ attitude.

Path dependence is also a phenomenon in technology: and both success and failure have historical causes. Understanding path dependence can help us to make sense of our organisations and our systems, and, maybe, make better decisions for now and for the future.
