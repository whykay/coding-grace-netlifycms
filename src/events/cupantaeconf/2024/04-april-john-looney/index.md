faq: "#### Is this event for women only? \nAll genders can apply. We encourage a diverse community of programmers. You are welcome to be a +1 as an ally supporting this event. 

#### ‚òïÔ∏è Why tea?
Pizzas and beer have been a staple of tech events, and why not discuss tech over a cup of tea?

As we build our Cup√°n Tae community, we aim to have more in-person conferences with tea-tasting and afternoon tea along with the talks and unconference sessions.

As part of our series, we will definitely recommend tea so you can join us and our speakers with a nice cuppa tea.

# Hang on, but what is Cup√°n Tae Conf?
Cup√°n Tae (/kup-awn tay/), or a cup of tea in Irish. Cup√°n Tae is a brand new experience of events by Coding Grace beginning with a series of virtual events where industry professionals will hear renowned speakers impart their experiences with opportunities to network over a ‚Äúcup of tea‚Äù. 

## Virtual events? Tell me more.
Cup√°n Tae will be taking place virtually.
Talks will be streamed to our Youtube channel (link will be shared with ticket holders).
Q&A and breakout sessions will take place on Coding Grace's Discord server.

### Each virtual talk event
* Guest speaker will give a talk for 1 hour.
* Participants freely break up into groups for networking and discussions for 1 hour

# The first series will consist of 3 virtual speaking events
#### Talk 1: "Path Dependence: History Matters" with Laura Nolan on Tuesday, 26th March 2024 (13:00 - 15:00)
* [https://cupantaeconf.com/path-dependence-history-matters](https://cupantaeconf.com/path-dependence-history-matters)


#### Talk 2: "Classic Vulnerabilities" with Patricia Aas on Tuesday, 7th May 2024 (18:00 - 20:00)
* [https://cupantaeconf.com/classic-vulnerabilities-by-patricia-aas](https://cupantaeconf.com/classic-vulnerabilities-by-patricia-aas/)

#### Talk 3 - Second System Effect - not a new problem by John Looney - April 4 (13:00 - 15:00)
* [https://cupantaeconf.com/second-system-effect-not-a-new-problem](https://cupantaeconf.com/second-system-effect-not-a-new-problem/)


##   Some principles (taken from DDD Open Spaces) for breakout sessions in both events
* Whoever comes are the right people. A session with two people can be as valuable as a session with ten.
* When it starts is the right time to start, and when it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over. And if it‚Äôs not over, make plans for continuing the conversation.
* Whatever happens is the only thing that could've happened.
* The Law of Two Feet: If you‚Äôre not getting value from a session, or not contributing value, feel free to go somewhere else. This way you can make the most of your time at the event.

# "Second System Effect - not a new problem" by John Looney
## Talk Description
We will discuss why after 70 years of software engineering, we still struggle to replace obsolete systems with something better. It comes down to a mix of boundless human optimism and lack of appreciation for dependencies we don't understand.

### About John Looney
John Looney is an infrastructure software engineer for Reddit, based in Dublin. Before that, he has supported various large-scale distributed systems vital to Google, Facebook and Intercom. He has taught classes in site reliability, computer hardware, networking distributed systems, and sits on the Steering Committee for SREcon.
