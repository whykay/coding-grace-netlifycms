A beginner-friendly introduction to F# with our special guest mentor from UK, Scott Wlaschin. 

Lunch will be included.

The morning session will focus on the core principles of functional programming using F# as our functional language.  We'll cover all the important concepts of functional programming in a series of short lessons, including composition, partial application, higher-order functions, error handling, and more.

The afternoon session will explore the "algebraic" type system used by F#, and how it can be used for domain modelling that is understandable to the non-technical customer, yet usable as an executable specification.  

We’ll also see why F# doesn’t allow nulls, and how you can model optional values and choices in a simple and elegant way. We’ll also demonstrate how to encode business rules by using types, so that you cannot even compile code that doesn’t fit the rules! 

Pre-requisites: 

* Need a laptop running F# (see fsharp.org for download instructions)
* Some basic experience with F# would be helpful (e.g. do the beginner exercises at [tryfsharp.org](http://tryfsharp.org) or [F# Koans](https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans)
