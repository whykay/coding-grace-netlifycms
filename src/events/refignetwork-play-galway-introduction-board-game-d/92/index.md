This diversity-friendly workshop is the second part of a series of beginners workshops.

**Description:** Boardgame design is collaborative, expressive, and fun! In this workshop, boardgame designer, Robin David O'Keeffe, will introduce participants to some new and exciting boardgames, giving a chance to play and leading a discussion on what makes modern boardgaming both exciting and unique. In small groups, participants will then produce their own games, taking advantage of their own skill sets - be that art, storytelling, music, or just about anything.
