Due to popular enquiries about beginners Python workshop, I'll be running another evening session.

Please make sure you have Python 2.7.6 on your laptop before coming to the workshop.

* Linux/MacOSX: Open a terminal and type "python", and there should be no errors.
* Windows: See if IDLE / Python 2.7.6 is installed. If not, go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you don't have a editor to write your code on, we have the following recommendations:

* [PyCharm Editor](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
