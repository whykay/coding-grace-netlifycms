faq: "### Q. Is this event for me?\r\nWhether you are new to Raspberry Pi or have\
  \ an ongoing project, this is the event for you. For those new to this, you can\
  \ check out what the hobbyists are working on, like a live demo.\r\n\r\nAnd you\
  \ will be at TOG Hackerspace who runs regular microcontroller nights, so you can\
  \ check out the space and talk to their members, some of whom will be helping out\
  \ on the day if you have questions.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: __This is NOT a workshop.__\
  \ It's all self-driven, self-learning day of fun and experimentation, it's ok to\
  \ FAIL. :-)\r\n\r\n### Q. Why is this an 18+ event?\r\nThe organisers are not Garda\
  \ vetted or taken any child protection courses. By law we are required to have both.\
  \ Because we are all volunteers and event is held in different venues, we decided\
  \ it would be best to focus on providing this event for adults only.\r\n\r\n####\
  \ What is Garda vetting?\r\nThe National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable\
  \ Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 provide a statutory basis for the vetting of persons\
  \ carrying out relevant work with children or vulnerable persons. The Act also creates\
  \ offences and penalties for persons who fail to comply with its provisions. The\
  \ Act stipulates that a relevant organisation shall not permit any person to undertake\
  \ relevant work or activities on behalf of the organisation, unless the organisation\
  \ receives a vetting disclosure from the National Vetting Bureau in respect of that\
  \ person. Garda vetting is conducted on behalf of registered organisations only\
  \ and is not conducted for individual persons on a personal basis. If you are seeking\
  \ employment or intending to volunteer with an organisation which conducts relevant\
  \ work, you may be asked to make an application to be vetted.\r\n\r\n[https://vetting.garda.ie/](https://vetting.garda.ie/)\r\
  \n\r\n#### About Child first legislation\r\nThe Children First Act 2015 (the Act),\
  \ which was signed into law on 19 November 2015, puts elements of the Children First:\
  \ National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on a statutory footing.\
  \ The legislation was a key Programme for Government commitment, and forms part\
  \ of a suite of child protection legislation which includes the National Vetting\
  \ Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts, 2012-2016 and the Criminal Justice\
  \ (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons)\
  \ Act 2012.\r\n\r\n[https://www.dcya.gov.ie/docs/EN/Children-First-Legislation/2758.htm](https://www.dcya.gov.ie/docs/EN/Children-First-Legislation/2758.htm)\r\
  \n\r\n### Q. Do I need to bring anything?\r\nAll participants bring their own equipment\
  \ (laptop, Pis, electronics, and so on).\r\n\r\nCoding Grace has 4 [Pi-Tops](https://pi-top.com/products/pi-top/)\
  \ with its kits and various electronic components for anyone who's new to Raspberry\
  \ Pi and want to play around with it. There will be some projects from Raspberry\
  \ Pi printed out so people can go through them on their own time.\r\n\r\nYou order\
  \ your own electronics from the following online stores:\r\n\r\n* [https://pimoroni.com](https://pimoroni.com/)\r\
  \n* [https://www.mouser.ie](https://www.mouser.ie/)\r\n* [http://ie.farnell.com/buy-raspberry-pi](http://ie.farnell.com/buy-raspberry-pi)\r\
  \n\r\n#### Where to buy a Pi in Ireland\r\nRS Ireland is the official distributor\
  \ in Ireland of the Raspberry Pi and long term partner\r\n\r\n* [https://ie.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/1373331/](https://ie.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/1373331/)\r\
  \n\r\n### Q. How do I get to TOG?\r\nCheck out TOG's page on info on how to get\
  \ to TOG via walking, cycling, bus, driving: https://www.tog.ie/location/\r\n\r\n\

We had our very first Pi Jam back in Sat Aug 11 @ Science Gallery. Overall it was a success even though we learnt lots of what can go wrong will go wrong. And it's OK to FAIL as that's the jam is about, to learn from things we don't understand and ask others for help. Vicky wrote a post about the day, you can read all about it here: [http://www.codinggrace.com/news/first-dublin-raspberry-pi-jam-2018-8-31/](http://www.codinggrace.com/news/first-dublin-raspberry-pi-jam-2018-8-31/)

The focus of the next jam (hosted by [TOG Hackerspace](https://www.tog.ie/)) would be more on bringing your own equipment and work through projects, and we want to emphasise that it is not a workshop, it's an event where you feel free to ask questions and for help as well as share your own project and ideas to one another.

This event is open to all levels.
