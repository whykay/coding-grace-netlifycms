# Testimonials

> My startup idea had hit a brick wall until TechFoundHer pushed me way over it.

> Real, no nonsense female speakers who talk from personal experience, not tech heads or corporate monkeys spouting jargon!

> I liked that I came away feeling empowered. I am not a techie, but knowing that that I can tap into tech advice and talent was huge for me.

> It was a super inspiring day. The speakers were excellent and really brought their A-game and shared the gold - so many insights and takeaways. One of the most powerful aspects for me is that there was such a diverse group of women in the room.
