Maths Caf√© is for people who want to brush up on their school maths or who maybe never fully got it in the first place :) 

We know you're going to be rusty! So, we start each topic from scratch. What you can expect is a lecture-free, relaxed, sociable and engaging experience.

We'll be using a new app, Slam, that supports face-to-face collaborative learning.

What's more, all proceeds go to the R&D of Ireland's only entry (that we know of!) for the Global Learning [XPRIZE](http://learning.xprize.org/), a competition to enable child-driven learning.

The first session is functions and [trigonometry](http://www.businessinsider.com/7-gifs-trigonometry-sine-cosine-2013-5?IR=T).
