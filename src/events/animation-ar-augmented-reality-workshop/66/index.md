An introduction to ARToolkit with Alex and Sam

### Description

Pete would start with 3d scanning through photogrammetry, using 3dsmax, Mudbox, Photoshop and ither Agisoft Photoscan or Autodesk memento (Memento is the more accessible as it's web based and free). 
From that, generate and patch up a 3d model that is game ready, there'd be some work to do on the modelling side and some work to do on textures in Photoshop. When the model is ready, over to Sam who can take it through the process of getting into Augmented Reality through ARToolkit on Unity3D.
