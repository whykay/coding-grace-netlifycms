short_description: I forgot to shout out about our July newsletter and since it's
  nearly the end of the month, it's a good chance for us to collate events and announcements
  for our upcoming August newsletter. In the meantime, here's some upcoming events
  you might be interested in, and do share if there's more July events that I've missed
  out.
