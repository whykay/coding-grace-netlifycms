Thanks to everyone who came along, especially to our mentors and Zendesk for hosting.

Here are the slides:

Credit to [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com) for their [Creating an App guide](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/), I think people actually went a bit further then that section, which is awesome!

The funny part was right at the beginning when we couldn't fit everyone in the kitchen and we though we might split up the the beginners from those who coded before, and we ended up with the bigger group moving to the high desk with 2 whiteboards, which in the end suited the other group as the big (and I mean ginormous) tv was used for going through some slides and code.

After a break with some nice sambos (which finally arrived) from Morton's, everyone went straight back to the practical workshop.

The day flew and everyone had a good time, and Coding Grace would be looking forward to going back to Zendesk for more Ruby/Rails workshops. ;-)

Here are some photos from the day: [https://www.icloud.com/photostream/#A2GI9HKKGO1YvY](https://www.icloud.com/photostream/#A2GI9HKKGO1YvY)

If you have questions, your projects/ideas to share, you can join our [FORUM](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coding-grace).

Again, big thanks to all who made it possible from Zendesk (with their amazing shiney office) to all our mentors (Andrei, Dave, Steve and Mick) and to everyone who came along to the workshop.
