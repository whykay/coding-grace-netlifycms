<div class="alert alert-info">
ℹ️ NOTE: This post is not updated anymore as the blog is getting very long; posting for June events onwards via this <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/live-blog-part-2-virtual-tech-events-during-covid-19-2020-6-1/">new live blog</a>.
</div>

With all the news of COVID-19 and [the Irish Government's advisory statement regarding events](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/7f81ee-statement-from-the-national-public-health-emergency-team-march-13/) held indoors and outdoors, this has a big knock on effect.

Initially before the statement, some were keeping watch and on the fence about cancelling or postponing. Many that have events this month and early next month have already postponed it to later this year. So come autumn and winter, conference season will be even more busier than normal.

Here's some events and conferences who have adapted to having their events virtually (I'll try and keep this post updated).

# 🌈 Finally

As our Taoiseach said in [his statement](https://www.gov.ie/en/speech/5a280b-statement-by-an-taoiseach-on-measures-to-tackle-covid-19-washington/) on Thursday (Mar 12th):

<blockquote class="blockquote">
 "I know that some of this is coming as a real shock and it is going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives. [...] We’re doing it for each other. Together, we can slow the virus in its tracks and push it back. Acting together, as one nation, we can save many lives."
</blockquote>

Let's do our part and make sure help slow down the spread of the virus and protect our community and all those loved ones around us. ❤️
