Our day began with projector hunting and trying o get the projector to work. You always have one technical setback at a tech workshop. Once we got it working, [Vicky](http://about.me/whykay) welcomed everyone and went through a [few slides](https://bytebucket.org/codinggrace/html5-css3-workshop/raw/tip/workshops/beginners/2014-06-28-workshop_files/01_welcome-slides.pdf) about what Coding Grace is about. And of course where Coding Grace's name came from, our role model, Grace Hopper. Here's a video of her explaining the nanosecond, if you want to watch it again or share with others: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eyFDBPk4Yw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eyFDBPk4Yw)

Christina then went through the first [two lessons](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ow20LSm6rEjwPcDitep_i5p56cOAsdMq0bUnBmyMJHs/edit#slide=id.p) (HTML5 followed by CSS3) along with a [live demo](https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/html5-css3-workshop/src/tip/workshops/beginners/2014-06-28-workshop_files/?at=default) followed by everyone going through the freeform exercises.

I have to mention that the facilities at RUA RED are fantastic. The Green Room where we went for our lunch break was bright and airy and they had a full kitchenette for us to use. Sandwiches and goodies platter were provided by [Sweet Cicely](http://www.sweetcicely.ie).

Following the break, Vicky went through the [final lesson](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ow20LSm6rEjwPcDitep_i5p56cOAsdMq0bUnBmyMJHs/edit#slide=id.p) on more about CSS with a [live demo](https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/html5-css3-workshop/src/tip/workshops/beginners/2014-06-28-workshop_files/?at=default). This is proceeded by the final freeform exercise.

A few things to note from the session:
