Coding Grace is part of a working paper: **The spaces, mobilities and soundings of coding** by [Sung-Yeuh Perng](https://twitter.com/syperng) and [Sophia Maalsen](http://www.researchonline.mq.edu.au/vital/access/Bibliography/Maalsen,%20Sophia) that has been developed as a pre-print for a chapter in an exciting book Experiencing Networked Urban Mobilities, edited by Katrine Hartmann-Petersen, Emmy Laura Perez Fjalland and Malene Freudendal-Pedersen. 

Sung-Yeuh and Sophie were regular attendees in most of Coding Grace and PyLadies Dublin meetups, and I am so happy that we took part in their research, and now it's going to be published.

Thanks to all who attended and happy to answer their questions.
