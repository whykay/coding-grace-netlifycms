The [Network in Play](http://gamedevelopers.ie/diversity) partners (including Coding Grace, [gamedevelopers.ie](http://gamedevelopers.ie/), [Imirt](http://www.imirt.ie/), [Pulse College](http://www.pulsecollege.eu/), [Dogpatch Labs](http://dogpatchlabs.com/) and [Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/)) are organising three FREE workshops in Dublin in August/Sept. aimed at beginners who are interested in learning about designing, writing and coding for games.

These workshops follow up on our earlier surveys which we discussed in an earlier feature on [our Network in Play page](http://gamedevelopers.ie/the-diversity-game/).

These are diversity friendly workshops, which means we are looking for people from a diverse range of backgrounds, interests and identities. These workshops are aimed at people aged 18 and over.

They are **FREE** to attend and we encourage people to attend all three workshops. Workshops will last for approx. 3 hours with a break for a light lunch (provided).

## We are organising the following 3 workshops:

To be eligible, you must not be currently studying on a games-related post-secondary course, have prior experience in making games, or work in the games industry.

We are open to creatives (artists, storytellers, creative writers, musicians) and other non-programmers.

We will ask you a few background questions on signup and some follow up questions after the workshops to assess how you think things went.

### Code of Conduct

To provide an inclusive and safe environment to learn, we have a Code of Conduct: [http://gamedevelopers.ie/diversity/refig-nip-code-of-conduct/](http://gamedevelopers.ie/diversity/refig-nip-code-of-conduct/)
