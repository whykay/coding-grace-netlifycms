<p>It was a mixed bag outside where it's sunny one minute and hailing the next, but one thing is for sure, we had a class full of enthusiastic workshoppers who can't wait to learn about Python.</p>
<p>After handing out stickers and announcement of 5 private repositories&nbsp; for participants for 1 year (thanks <a href="http://github.com" title="One of our in-kind sponsors - gihub">github</a>), we got straight into making sure everyone is settled in and that they are set up for the upcoming lectures.</p>
<p>Rigel began by going through <a href="http://bit.ly/cg-py-sat" title="Coding Grace - Saturday's lecture">Saturday's lecture notes</a>.</p>

<p>Lunch time came along at 12pm with some nice sandwiches from <a href="http://www.sweetcicely.ie/" title="Sweet Cicely">Sweet Cicely</a>.

<p>After lunch, it was lightning talks on various topics</p>

<p>After the lightning talks, I finished the rest of the Python lecture and wrapped up by going through one of the examples from ColorWall. We didn't have enough time to go through Wordplay or Twitter.</p>
<p>The long day was coming to a close, I'm sure there was information overload for those taking part in the workshop, I was really tired by this stage (as was everyone including the volunteers) and with help of Rigel and Mick's prompting I was able to continue on after my little hamster in my brain refused to work when I started the lecture; tiredness or stage fright (or both). It was my first time and I actually enjoyed it given the circumstances. And Mick did make a nice assistant pointing at the whiteboard for me during Colorwall. :-)</p>

<p>And finally... a huge thanks to all the volunteers and all the participants for making it happen. /whoop whoop <img alt="image" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lt9jxxoKcM1r4fmxfo1_500.gif" /></p>
