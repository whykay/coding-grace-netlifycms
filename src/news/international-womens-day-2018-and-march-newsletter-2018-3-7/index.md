Last night I had a great opportunity leading a workshop called "Designing Inclusive Events for Meetup Organisers" run by [Dogpatch Labs](https://dogpatchlabs.com) as part of their [Diversity in Tech Week](http://dogpatchlabs.com/diversityintechweek2018/). We had over 25 tech community organisers discussing various scenarios from how to handle incidents if they occur at their events to looking for speakers and venues. Lots of great experiences were shared, and takeaways from areas people never thought of when organising events. We also had the pleasure to have Alaina Percival, the global CEO of [Women Who Code](https://womenwhocode.com) joining us for the evening. It was a brilliant experience, I learnt a few things, and from the tweets from last night, I wasn't the only one who enjoyed it. A huge thanks to the community for their support and taking their lead to change how we run community events for the better. üôå
