Even with the Leaving Cert (good luck to the students BTW), there was no sunshine over the bank holiday weekend, maybe the weather will improve this week. But that means that we have more time indoors to skill up and find interesting new things. 

I don't know about you, but I was pretty excited about the ARKit announced at [Apple's WWCD Keynote](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2017/). Besides Swift workshop (which I still want to run), maybe this would be an interesting one to run in a few months time. Do you have anything exciting you want to learn from recent developer news from Google I/O and Apple's WWDC? I see [Dublin Kotlin meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Kotliners/) was set up recently, maybe folks might want to learn about that? Let us know, we are happy to find mentors to run workshops on these exciting new technologies.
