I attended the Elm workshop run by Mick Twomey who organises the [Elm Dublin User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Elm-User-Group-Dublin/).

* When: Tue July 5 (19:00 - 21:00)
* Where: The Liquor Rooms
* Event page: [http://www.meetup.com/Elm-User-Group-Dublin/events/231870837/](http://www.meetup.com/Elm-User-Group-Dublin/events/231870837/)

It was a quiet evening, the meetup had clashes with DublinJS and a FinTech event, but Mick was happy people showed up, so it was all good. The workshop will be based on the workshop [he and Andrea ran at The Joy of Coding conference](http://joyofcoding.org/speakers/andrea-magnorsky-michael-twomey.html). 

You can access the workshop and even play with it via [http://elm-workshop.twomeylee.name/](http://elm-workshop.twomeylee.name/) on your browser.

He started with brief intro to Elm 0.17, and you can find those files via [this repository](https://github.com/micktwomey/elm-0.17-dublin-elm-may-2016). 

After the quick run through of the Joy of Coding workshop, Mick pointed to a few things after questions from attendees, which was awesome:

* [elm-mdl](https://debois.github.io/elm-mdl/), an elm port of Google's [MDL](https://getmdl.io/started/)
* F# Implementation of The Elm Architecture - [Part 1](http://anthonylloyd.github.io/blog/2016/06/20/fsharp-elm-part1) / [Part 2](http://anthonylloyd.github.io/blog/2016/07/01/fsharp-elm-part2)
