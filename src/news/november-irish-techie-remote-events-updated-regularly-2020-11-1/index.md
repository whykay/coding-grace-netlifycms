<div class="alert alert-info">
	ℹ️ NOTE: This post is not updated anymore so it doesn't get too long (and arduous to maintain), check the <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/">for the latest new live blog</a> for the current month.
</div>

You can find archives of previous virtual events at: <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/covid-19-and-changes-how-tech-communities-handle-events-and-conferences-2020-3-14">March to June</a> | <a href="https://codinggrace.com/news/live-blog-part-2-virtual-tech-events-during-covid-19-2020-6-1/">July</a> | <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/live-blog-part-3-virtual-tech-events-during-covid-19-2020-7-31/">August</a> | <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/virtual-tech-events-live-blog-part-4-september-edition-2020-8-31/">September</a> | <a href="https://codinggrace.com/news/virtual-tech-events-live-blog-part-5-2020-10-1/">October</a>

I'll keep track of virtual tech events from October onwards here. This seems to be a norm, so to a point where this live blog is not needed anymore, I'll stop, and will just have them in our monthly Coding Grace newsletter. (Also helps me so I don't double up on the work maintaining the lists on a blog and newsletter).


Let me know either via <a href="mailto:contact@codinggrace.com">contact@codinggrace.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/codinggrace">@CodingGrace</a> if you want to include:-

* a missing upcoming event
* announcements
* call to actions / help
* opportunities / grants 

Here's some events and conferences who have adapted to having their events virtually (I'll try and keep this post updated).
