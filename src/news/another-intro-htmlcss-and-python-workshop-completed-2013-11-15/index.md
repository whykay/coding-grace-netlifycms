<p>Two workshops in two weeks! It has been busy with Coding Grace &amp; Co.</p>
<p>First off is the HTML/CSS workshop in partnership with AIB. A big shout out to the staff who helped make it happen and helped out during the biggest and busiest week that is Web Summit. With a full house, we proceeded with the workshop with lots of enthusiasm from both participants and mentors. We didn't get a chance to tweet much as we spent most our time working on the exercises.&nbsp;</p>
