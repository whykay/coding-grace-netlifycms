GameCraft has joined Coding Grace Foundation family. GameCraft has been running community in-person game jams since 2012, and was co-founded by Andrea Magnorsky, and Vicky Twomey-Lee. Previous directors and committee members were Aphra Kerr, Andrew O Connor, Bryan Duggan, Darren Kearney, David McCabe, Michael Twomey, Naoise Collins, and Siobhan Schnittger.

GameCraft has partnered with Coding Grace on game-related events in the past such as the Diversity in Games projects called NetworkInPlay: Crafting Diversity in Games in 2016 and 2018.

Here's the official statement:

> Coding Grace Foundation welcomes GameCraft, who has been running in-person community game jams since 2012, as part of the Coding Grace organisation.
> 
> Coding Grace Foundation will be looking after the adminstration when it comes to GameCraft finances, the day-to-day functions, organisation, running, hosting events and other games-related collaborations will remain with GameCraft.
> 
> We look forward to many game-related community events and their support of local games communities running their own events.
> 
> â€” Vicky Twomey-Lee (Co-Founder), Michael Twomey (Director), Andrea Magnorsky (Director)
