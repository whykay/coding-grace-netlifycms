<p>Thanks to <a href="http://sciencegallery.com">Science Gallery</a> for hosting our workshop.</p>
<p>After a slight delay in starting the workshop, and making sure everyone had the latest version of <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> installed on their laptop, we got stuck into it by loading an sample Unity project, and learnt the basic move, panning, rotating, scale as well as how easy it can be to get lost in the 3D virtual world when placing objects on the plane.</p>
<p>Owen proceeded to get everyone to have some fun by creating a new scene, add a terrain, painting the terrain, make mountains/valleys, add textures, create palettes. We did have some disappointed voices when Owen moved on to other features when they were having fun designing their level, but was rest assured there was plenty of time for level design near the end of the workshop.</p>
<script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<p>By the end of the workshop, we were able to understand the environment a little, make our terrain with mountains, valleys, trees, water and adding a sky. So a wee bit of physics, importance of tagging, importing and running scripts, as well as importing assets from the Unity Assets Store. This led us being able to pick up objects like a sphere and chuck it at a rigid structure. And finally build and run our own game.</p>

<h3>Here are some of Owen's recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://3dbuzz.com/training/topic/unity" title="3DBuzz - Training - Unity">http://3dbuzz.com/training/topic/unity<br /></a>More for making environments; unity fundamentals.<br />There is a practical game development paid courses (but worth it) <br />These are mainly video tutorials</li>
<li><a href="http://www.burgzergarcade.com/" title="http://www.burgzergarcade.com/">burgzergarcade.com<br /></a>It is code heavy; advance coding side of unity; handles a lot of data giant game</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PushyPixels" title="Youtube - Cooking with Unity">youtube - "cooking with unity"</a> (C#)<br />Begins with space invaders, &nbsp;infinite runner, and lots more.</li>
<li><a href="http://unity3d.com/learn" title="Unity official tutorials">unity3d.com/learn</a> (language agnostic) professional training<br />It has a more&nbsp;succinct&nbsp;tutorial section where they have 5 minute video on what was covered in the workshop, e.g. physics, rigid body</li>
<li><a href="http://walkerboystudio.com/" title="http://walkerboystudio.com/">walkerboystudio.com</a>&nbsp;(JavaScript)<br />Tutorials like Mario games</li>
<li><a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/" title="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">colorschemedesigner.com<br /></a>Get a colour scheme; great for how games look.</li>
