### [EDIT] Forgot to mention that there's a Dublin JS meetup on May 5th @ Intercom. Details at: [http://www.meetup.com/DublinJS/events/220989428/](http://www.meetup.com/DublinJS/events/220989428/)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Great turnout at our <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Javascript?src=hash">#Javascript</a> workshop this morning. <a href="http://t.co/cuswve6QXl">pic.twitter.com/cuswve6QXl</a></p>&mdash; Coding Grace (@CodingGrace) <a href="https://twitter.com/CodingGrace/status/589382886891134976">April 18, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Big thanks to everyone who came along, our mentors ([David](https://twitter.com/davecocoa7), [Brian](http://btmatthews.com/), [Blain](https://twitter.com/BlainMaguire), [Pat](https://twitter.com/patocallaghan) and [Mick](https://twitter.com/micktwomey)), and to [Zendesk](http://www.zendesk.com/) for hosting our workshop. I want to also shout out a special thanks to [Dean McDonnell](https://twitter.com/mcdonnelldean) who donated two Javascript workshop tickets which I forwarded on to [An Cosán](http://www.ancosan.ie/), a fantastic organisation who are helping so many people.

There was some setting up for this workshop, to re-cap:

_(Note: If on a Mac, there might be a need to install XCode, this is a huge download. Once downloaded, you will need to run XCode once to get everything set up.)_

* Installing node, instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/wiki/Installation-suggestions).
* `npm install -g javascripting`
* Recommended to get [Sublime Text Editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

To start running the workshop, go to your terminal, and type: `javascripting`.

A major feeback from folks was that they typed `<` and `>`, and it's causing errors. It is actually `(` and `)`, the visually incorrect characters is due to the bad font in the console.
