We ran our 1st workshop of 2019, here's a quick write-up with resources. 🙌👩‍💻👩🏻‍💻👩🏼‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩🏾‍💻👩🏿‍💻

First of all, a huge thanks to all who signed up to attend the workshop, and to [Mick Twomey](https://twitter.com/micktwomey) for helping me. Next to is thanks [Dogpatch Labs](https://dogpatchlabs.com) for hosting us.

During the workshop, I realised the Python scripts some folks were using were the older version (in Python 2 as well), if you had problems running the scripts, you can download the latest Python scripts again (I've removed all the other .zip files) via [https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/python-project-workshop/downloads/](https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/python-project-workshop/downloads/)

See screenshot below:

For those who are curious of other examples of interactive games you want to try out:

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-slide="5" data-id="a0a1da7148404c24b9438957020923f5" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

Also mentioned:

* Black Mirrors Bandersnatch: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch)
* Banner Saga: [https://bannersaga.com/](https://bannersaga.com/)

Other user groups to be aware of if you want to continue on learning about Python and meeting others in the Python community:

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-slide="6" data-id="a0a1da7148404c24b9438957020923f5" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

Most code editors have this feature where you can run code in the terminal in your editor. Here's how you can open the terminal to use on VS Code:

We ran out of time at the end, here are some resources to follow up:

* Hitch Hikers Guide to Python - [docs.python-guide.org](https://docs.python-guide.org/)
* Django Girls Tutorial (Free) - [tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html)
* Other fun ways to learn to code - [slant.co/options/17534/alternatives/~codewars-alternatives](https://www.slant.co/options/17534/alternatives/~codewars-alternatives )
* Coding Grace's resources- [codinggrace.com/resources/#python](https://www.codinggrace.com/resources/#python) -- I will update this page with the ones above

After you are comfortable with basics of Python, you should try [Newcoder.io](http://newcoder.io/) tutorials, which are self-driven projects.

I forgot to mention the Raspberry Pi Jam in the slides, it's on Sat Mar 2 at TOG Hackerspace as part of the official celebrations of Raspberry Pi's 7th birthday with other jams around the world. It's FREE to attend, more details at [https://ti.to/dublin-raspberry-pi-jam/raspberry-jam-big-birthday-event-2019](https://ti.to/dublin-raspberry-pi-jam/raspberry-jam-big-birthday-event-2019).
