The son of cartoonist Bil Keane (The Family Circus), Glen learned early on the importance of holding onto your childhood creativity&mdash;and how art can powerfully convey emotion. Keane has spent his career embracing new tools, from digital environments to 3D animation to today&rsquo;s virtual reality, which finally enables him to step into his drawings and wander freely through his imagination. At FoST, he&#039;ll explore how to tap into your own creativity, connecting to emotion and character more directly than ever before.</em>
