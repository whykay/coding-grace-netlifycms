Arrived at the [The Playhouse](https://twitter.com/PlayhouseDerry) to find ourselves in the middle of a Minecraft tournament, and Camilla ([Honeycomb Creative Works](http://thehoneycomb.net/)), showed us the room we were to set up and run the workshop in.

I introduced what Coding Grace is about and who Grace actually is.

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="749574102ab50132c32622d14c40df16" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

You won't be able to see the video in the slides, here it is if you and anyone is curious about her explanation of the nanosecond:

I also recommend this longer video of Grace Hopper on the Letterman show (this wasn't shown at the workshop):

<iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1-vcErOPofQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

After the introduction, aside from one or two re-installations of Python, people installed [Sublime Text Editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/), and got their copy of the [workshop content](https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/python-project-workshop/src/bf6dbe7a50813782dbb187f86d5a6eddd3f755dc/workshops/text_based_adventure_game/?at=default).

We got stuck in going through the Python scripts introducing

* what a Python script it and how to execute it

    - For those using Windows, unless you have it set up in your environment (we didn't cover this in the workshop), you will need to type the full path (where the application can be found on the system), e.g.

        `c:\python27\python.exe THE_NAME_OF_FILE`

        OR

        `c:\python34\python.exe THE_NAME_OF_FILE`

* which leads to the interactive terminal, the [command line interface (CLI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and [Python interpreter](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/interpreter.html).

    NOTE: There's a [Quick Start guide](https://bytebucket.org/codinggrace/python-project-workshop/raw/bf6dbe7a50813782dbb187f86d5a6eddd3f755dc/workshops/text_based_adventure_game/quickstart-guide.pdf) in the folder containing the workshop files and gives you a quick 101 in CLI and using the Python interpreter.

The interactiveness of the game delves into taking input from user playing the game, and doing something with it showing the basic datatypes likes numbers and strings, various ways of comparing input to determine the outcome, declaring functions, variables, and [data structures](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html) like if statements, for and while loops.

A notes for those using Python 3.0 for this workshop:

* `raw_input` is `input`

Oh and here are some smiling faces at the workshop. :-)
