  short_description: "A happy new year to everyone! What better way than to start\
    \ your year learning about Raspberry Pi?\r\n\r\nThe Raspberry Pi is a credit-card\
    \ sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little\
    \ computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things\
    \ that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It\
    \ also plays high-definition video."

<p>The workshop started with me welcoming everyone and thanking our sponsors&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookdublin" title="Facebook Dublin">Facebook Dublin</a></strong> (host, food and equipment),&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://python.ie" title="Partner - Python Ireland">Python Ireland</a>&nbsp;</strong>(our partner) and&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://fieldaware.com" title="Thanks for the big switch, helped us out big time">Fieldaware</a></strong> (20-port switch).</p>
<p>Aisling introduced the Raspberry Pi (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/31k04ukzr6labme/02%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Raspberry%20Pi%20%28Coding%20Grace%29.pdf" title="Introductin to Raspberry Pi slides">slides</a>) followed by <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14gKm6RXM0JkSG9hRvqf-J-gEjlVvp-2j2OsU-2-s-wQ/edit?usp=sharing" title="Linux Basics slides">Linux Basics</a> by Jimmy while everyone kicked off their <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/4100" title="Noobs for Raspberry Pi blog post">Noobs</a> installation on their Raspberry Pis.</p>
<p>Mick and Jimmy demod their own Pis with projects they have prepared earlier while N00bs was busy installing. <iframe frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/jTqVAUjRUd/embed/" width="612"></iframe></p>
<p>Once Noobs was installed, everyone settled down to set up their Pis and started to work on the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/introduction-to-raspberry-pi/src/tip/workshops/18%20Jan%202014/?at=default" title="Project page (also contains resources and tips)">various projects prepared by the mentors</a> with the mentors on hand to help people out if they had questions.</p>
<p>The morning and early afternoon pretty much flew with people working on various projects, sharing hardware (webcam, speakers, game controllers), playing games, and also with Mick stationed with his Pis giving tutorials on GPIO and camera on his own Pis.</p>
<p>It was a sugar-filled and Raspberry Pi-delic day and big thanks to everyone who came along and made it so much fun and possible.</p>
<p>We will have another Raspberry Pi workshop, so if you haven't subscribed to our newsletter, please do do via <a href="http://codinggrace.com" title="Coding Grace website">codinggrace.com</a>. You can join the mailing list as well and chat with one another, ask questions, propose more ideas or requests for workshops.</p>
