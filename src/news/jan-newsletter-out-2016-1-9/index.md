A reminder about our upcoming wearable electronics workshop on Sat Jan 23 kindly hosted by [Dogpatch Labs](http://dogpatchlabs.com/). Ticket price includes lunch and electronic components. Just bring a laptop and you get to bring home your creations after the workshop.

[Code for Ireland](https://bit.ly/CommunityHackathon) will be on the same day and place as us, it would be a great way to check what folks are doing in a hackathon. :-)
