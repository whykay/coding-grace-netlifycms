<p>I (Vicky) joined in with the <a href="http://codinggrace.com/post/75089497572/introduction-to-r-workshop-sat-feb-15th" title="Coding Grace - Intro to R (Sat Feb 15th 2014)">R workshop</a> with <a href="http://ie.linkedin.com/in/rachaelmcbride" title="Rachael McBride">Rachael</a> at the helm showing how much cool stuff we can do with R.</p>
<p>Aside from a little WiFi #fail, we went for the lower tech way of sharing <a href="https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/introduction-to-r-2014/get/tip.zip" title="Intro to R workshop files all zipped up for you to download">workshop files</a> via a USB stick (courtesy of Andrea, thankies for that!). NOTE: WiFi did stay up a wee bit in the end.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/" title="RStudio">RStudio</a> delightful to use, and I can see why Rachael chose it, simple, everything you need, execute your scripts and more. Great for beginners.</p>

<p>We had some guests showing the group how ggplot2 works (thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/statslabdublin" title="Kevin O'Brien">Kevin</a> of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DublinR/" title="Dublin R Meetup group">Dublin R Meetup</a>), and <a href="http://twitter.com/triploidtree" title="Tríona">Tríona</a> showing us how much fun she had with ggplot2&#160;<a href="http://www.scienceisdelicious.net/?p=407" title="Tríona's blog on &quot;Graphing with the twitter archive and R : or how I tweet too much&quot;">graphing how much she tweets with R</a> as well as showing how she uses it for her PhD research project. By the way, if you do like baking, check out her site, <a href="http://www.scienceisdelicious.net/" title="Tríona's blog, Science is delicious">Science is Delicious</a>. As Tríona said that &#8220;Life is too short!&#8221; and I agree. And lots of great tools were mentioned like <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" title="LaTex">LaTex</a> for beautiful documentation.</p>
<p>I wrote up some notes somewhere after part 2 of the workshop, if you downloaded the workshop files, it is called <em>vickynotes.R.</em>
