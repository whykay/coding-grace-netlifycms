  a bit of hiatus on figuring out what workshops to run, and being busy working with

I've asked for folks to RSVP their interest in Python and I have over 40 people who want to learn about Python, that's amazing! Keep your eyes peeled, I will be finding a venue for a weeknight this month with capacity for 15 people, so I will be running a few Python workshops in the coming months.

There a few things I want your attention about...
