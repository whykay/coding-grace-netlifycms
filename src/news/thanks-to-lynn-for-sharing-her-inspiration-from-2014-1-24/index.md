    \ your year learning about Raspberry Pi?\r\n\r\nThe Raspberry Pi is a credit-card\
    \ sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little\
    \ computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things\
    \ that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It\
    \ also plays high-definition video."

Thanks to Lynn for sharing her inspiration from our #RaspberryPi workshop. It's aÂ raspberry pi hooked up to my Maplins robotic arm - trying to teach it to prepare the tea!

Anyone else have a Pi project to share? Leave your comments below. :-)

A vid I took of Mick testing out his LEGO motor after hooking up with the Pi with a curious kitten in tow. (NOTE: No kittens, owners or even the LEGO robot got harmed)
