A special announcement from our friends at ImagiLabs, they are hosting an event as part of CodeWeekEU in Ireland on May 15.

Learn the basics of Python with imagiLabs' creative coding tools! Perfect for kids ages 9-15, this 1.5 hour workshop for beginners will take coders from lighting up one pixel at a time to making colorful animations.
