  short_description: Want to get crafty? This workshop will show you how to make LEDs
    light up and sow them onto anything you want. A mixture of coding fun with electronics
    and did you know there's such a thing as electronic threads!? Sounds awesome,
    right?

short_description: What a fun-filled Saturday, a big thanks to Dogpatch Labs for hosting.
  We shared the day with Code for Ireland. It was a day of dramatic blue smoke, shocks,
  being poked by needles, lessons on what not to do when playing with electronics,
  and that was one person!

What a funfilled Saturday, a big thanks to [Dogpatch Labs](http://dogpatchlabs.com/) for hosting. For people who are curious, we used [Seven Wonders](http://sevenwonders.ie/) for our tea/coffee and mixed sambo/wrap platters (they were super yummy). A huge shout out to [Margaret](http://www.timui.org/) and [Mick](https://twitter.com/micktwomey). [Cheryl](https://twiter.com/chebegeek) couldn't join us due to being sick, wishing her to get well soon.

We shared the day with [Code for Ireland](http://codeforireland.com/) who were having a [hackathon](https://ti.to/code-for-ireland/november-2015-meetup) on [Coder Dojo](https://coderdojo.com/)'s [Zen community platform](https://github.com/coderdojo/community-platform).

* [Flora RGB Smart NeoPixel version 2 - Pack of 4](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1260)
* [FLORA - Wearable electronic platform: Arduino-compatible - v2](https://www.adafruit.com/products/659)
* [2 x 2032 Coin Cell Battery Holder - 6V output with On/Off switch](https://www.adafruit.com/products/783)
* USB cable
* 2 x 2032 Coin Cel Batteries
* Conductive thread & needles

Extras: Crocodile clips for testing, and your fabrics/materials of choice.

## Setup, the first few steps before we started into our own little creations:

1. Installation: Install this first from Arduino - [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

1. Then you need to install the support for Flora - [https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-ide-setup/arduino-1-dot-6-x-ide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-ide-setup/arduino-1-dot-6-x-ide)

1. Let's get the onboard LED to blink on the Flora - [https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/blink-onboard-led](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/blink-onboard-led)

1. Now to get Neopixel's LEDs to light up, we need to install its library first before we can test it - [https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/blink-onboard-neopixel](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/blink-onboard-neopixel)

# Notes from the day

There was a question about what an unsigned bit is, and [@micktwomey](https://twitter.com/micktwomey) explained via whiteboard.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whykay/24532514601/in/album-72157662613487399/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1688/24532514601_8db066109d.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Untitled"></a>

Before the sowing starts, it's best to test with crocodile clips (although it takes a wee bit of mastering), here's an illustration of what some of us did via [https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-rgb-smart-pixels/hook-up-alligator-clips](https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-rgb-smart-pixels/hook-up-alligator-clips)

<hr>

So I decided to hook up 2 LEDs with the Flora, with some guidance from Mick as it's different from NeoPixels LED.

It was all going well... then disaster struck... well, that was a bit of an exaggeration, but for someone who doesn't sow, having to take out all the stitches and redo it all again is painstakingly slow for me.

But I finally sowed the thread connecting the right bits to each other:

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whykay/23986616824/in/album-72157662613487399/" title="Behind the scenes"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1537/23986616824_cfb180b5b0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Behind the scenes"></a>

I found this [handy guide on connecting a Flora to an LED](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/ldk-experiment-1-lighting-up-a-basic-circuit?_ga=1.77315414.253590958.1453554238). [Here's another good article with some nice tips](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/312) (I didn't have a sowing hoop, might get one as it makes things easier to sow). 

Here's what I ended up with (after taking out all the stitches as I had one of the LEDs the wrong way round... grr), good attempt and both eyes light up, I ended up making one eye stay on and the other blink.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whykay/23986622004/in/album-72157662613487399/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1713/23986622004_02552b680c.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Untitled"></a>

BTW, you are probably wondering why there is a pin through the poor panda's head, the LED on the right eye wasn't properly lined up, so it was a way to forcibly line it up to see what it looks like, it's a prototype after all. :-)
