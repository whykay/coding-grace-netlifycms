We are delighted to announce that [All The Tech Things](https://www.allthetechthings.com/) has sponsored a [Pi-Top](https://pi-top.com/products/pi-top/) which includes [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/). This will bring our total number of Pi-Tops to FOUR (includes the three that [Symantec sponsored us in July](http://www.codinggrace.com/news/ann-symantec-sponsors-3-pi-tops-incl-pis-2018-7-4/)).
