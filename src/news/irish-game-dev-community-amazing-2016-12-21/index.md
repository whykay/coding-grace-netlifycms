I got a surprise today, the Irish Game Dev community is amazing, and I am so happy that I was able to be part of that this year.

Here's what I wrote:

> Gosh, there's so many who inspired me and have been so supportive this year, especially sharing knowledge to those who want to learn more about making games, here's a list of folks in no particular order: All on imirt, it's great to see the community providing for the community. Aphra Kerr for including me in the Diversity in Games initiative. Chris Gregan and Paul for always jumping in to mentor Fungus workshops and teaching adults and kids alike. The ever so patient Robert McGregor who is so helpful in mentoring Unity workshop for Coding Grace, and to Declan who helped out and answered so many questions. And to Marc Diamond on how you run an unPlugged with kids at Inspirefest in July, everyone had so much fun and kids make the most amazing board games. To Robin O'Keefe for giving me more insight in designing board games at one of our diversity workshops. To Char and Owen for always being there answering any silly questions I may have and offering a helping hand. John O'Kane for Inis Sproai this year, I finally made it to one and it really gave me a new perspective on myself and the community. Brenda Romero for how she answered kids questions about becoming a game designer earlier this year at Coolest Projects, I share that story with many folks, especially kids and parents alike on the importance of doing well in Maths, English, History at school. Jen Carey on her new awesome venture, her contribution to the community and her support on stuff I do. Darren Kearney for all his amazing work with Galway Game Jam. To Bryan Duggan who have supported GameCraft and sorting us with venue and food when we need it. Folks who help and participate in GameCrafts this year, I'm still amazed with all the games made in 8 hours, and how friendly the community is as always. Everyone who turned up to the Christmas shindig is also inspiring for me as it shows how much the community has grown, and 2017 looks to be an amazing year. :-) <3 <3
