> Explore learning through failure at unFail: an unconference organised by wearehere

Failing is part of the journey. Come to the [#weAREhere](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wearehere) unconference for peer-to-peer learning, collaboration and creativity. The theme of the day is unFAIL and marks the end of the [#FailBetter](https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/failbetter) exhibition in the [Science Gallery](http://sciencegallery.com). 
Everyone gets a chance to talk about failures they have experienced in work and business with fellow entreprenuers, tech developers, and digital marketers.

In true unconference style the speakers and sessions will be selected on the day using open space technology. You pick and choose the sessions/speakers that interest you the most. The sessions convened will range from the formal to the informal. The emphasis is on having fun and learning from each other.

Advice for everyone at an unconference…
<strong>Go with the flow!</strong>
