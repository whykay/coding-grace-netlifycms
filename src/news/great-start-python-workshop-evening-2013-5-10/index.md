short_description: This evening flew even though we wrapped up just before 21:00.
  The atmostphere was quite relaxed, we have an informal introduction of everyone
  (which I'm sure most people remembered each other names, right?!), I gave a quick
  introduction about Coding Grace and how it came to be. A few comments on why people
  came along which ranged from curiosity to bringing back knowledge to their own classes
  that they mentor (no pressure, heehee).

<p>This evening flew even though we wrapped up just before 21:00. The atmostphere was quite relaxed, we have an informal introduction of everyone (which I'm sure most people remembered each other names, right?!), I gave a quick introduction about Coding Grace and how it came to be. A few comments on why people came along which ranged from curiosity to bringing back knowledge to their own classes that they mentor (no pressure, heehee).</p>
<p>A few things that I found on my browser tabs after I got home:-</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ojnetworks.com.au/2012/04/solution-keyboard-issue-apostrophe-double-quote-quotation-marks-tilde-hat-key-pressed-windows-7/">Solution for Keyboard issue/problem &ndash; Apostrophe and Double Quote, Quotation marks, Tilde and Hat do not appear until another key is pressed on Windows 7</a></li>
<li>Python (via <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png">XKCD</a>)<br /><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/4e6c238477813abd5335d7bf51b54c15/tumblr_inline_mmlsnrX1rU1qz4rgp.png" /></li>
<li>sudo comic (via <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png">XKCD</a>)<img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/5e50e3c0ee4bb967610271e4e43862c3/tumblr_inline_mmlskrnMrY1qz4rgp.png" /><br /><br /></li>
<li><a href="http://www.portablepython.com/wiki/Documentation">Portable Python</a> - no need for admin access to Windows, it's pretty much self-contained.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's one thing that needs to be updated for those who haven't set up their laptops, is the order of dependencies during setup.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; httplib2-0.6.0.zip<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; simplejson-2.1.6.zip<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twitter.zip<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oauth2.zip</p>
<p>Once installed, do the following in the interactive Python shell in your terminal/console:-</p>
<p>Type "python"</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; import httplib2⏎<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; import simplejson⏎<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; import twitter⏎<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; import oauth2⏎</p>
<p>Over all it was a successful evening. There wasn't much complaints about the notes, but they still need adjust.</p>
<p>I've also <a href="http://storify.com/whykay/coding-grace-1" title="Storify Coding Grace">storyified the day's experience</a> by some folks, there wasn't many tweets which is a good sign that people were working hard this evening. :-)</p>
<p>Now it's a 9am start tomorrow. I just have to remember to pack the rest of the print outs, Barry's tea, instant coffee, sugar, teaspoons and milk.</p>
<p>Now to get on and busily print out the rest of the handouts, and not melt our laser printer. :-D</p>
