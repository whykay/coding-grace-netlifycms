  short_description: "An introduction to the statistical programming language R, aimed\
    \ at beginners. The workshop will look mainly at working with the R programming\
    \ environment, using Packages, basic programming, working with data objects and\
    \ some programming statements such as For While and If. \r\nThe workshop is intended\
    \ for beginners. Statistical programming will be mentioned, but will be tangential\
    \ to the overall lesson outcome."

<p>Even on a nice sunny morning, 15 Coding Gracers came along to our Taste of R workshop.</p>
<p>Here are some workshop files from the day: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/a-taste-of-r/src" title="Coding Grace - A Taste of R workshop files">https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/a-taste-of-r/src</a><br /> <br /> The following package was mentioned (on the whiteboard): <a href="http://ggplot2.org/" title="ggplot2">ggplot2</a> (by <a href="http://had.co.nz/" title="Hadley Wickham">Hadley Wickham</a>)<br /> <br /> George Boole, an English man, a well-known mathematician at Queen's College in Cork, and inventor of the Boolean logic was mentioned when Kevin was explaining about <em>true </em>and <em>false</em>.<br /> <br /> Some set theory was covered but probability was the theme of the day.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://sciencegallery.com/risklab" title="Risk Lab @ Science Gallery">Risk lab</a> at the <a href="http://sciencegallery.com" title="Science Gallery">Science Gallery</a> was also mentioned and recommended a visit.</p>
<p>Here are a few notes while I was there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examining data sets - class to try the commands for</p>
<p><code>mtcarsdescribe(mtcars)</code></p>
<p>Get an error, so use command <code>install.packages(&ldquo;psych&rdquo;)</code></p>
<p>A CRAN mirror dialog appears, select Ireland (<a href="http://www.heanet.ie/" title="HEAnet">HEANet</a>), Internet connection required.</p>
<p><br /> After it successfully installed but if there is a problem, it could be because it assumes that you are downloading the latest pkg for that latest version of R. Just remember to keep R up-to-date.</p>
<p><br /> Run <em>describe</em> and still doesn't run, you need to specify where the command is coming from (like import), need to run <code>library(psych)</code><br /> Running <em>describe</em> again it should work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>Check out <em>SocialSciences</em> on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" title="cran-r">CRAN-r</a>; find <em>psych</em> to see its own reference manual and vignette.</div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>Use <em>sample()</em> to get random data from a data set, it's just resample again.</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br /> Another mention of Risk Lab which refers to the <a href="http://marilynvossavant.com/game-show-problem/" title="Game Show Problem">game show door problem</a> where 3 doors are presented to a contestant, they pick one door, the show host opens a door to a goat. There's one door left, do they want to switch door to win the big prize or stick with the door they picked. Marilyn vos Savant presented an argument to stick which caused furore when it was published in Parade Magazine, almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant#The_Monty_Hall_problem" title="The Monty Hall Problem">10,000 letters were written in saying she was wrong</a> and 1,000 of those letters were signed off by PhD signatures.</p>
<p>And finally a video of Grace Hopper's explanation of nanoseconds, which I found is a favourite to many I've shown it to so far. :-)</p>

<p>The workshop ended on time, and everyone seemed to be positive and I'm sure we have some R converts.</p>
