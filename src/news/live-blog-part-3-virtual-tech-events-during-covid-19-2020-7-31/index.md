short_description: Last live blog was getting bigger again, so I've created a new
  one for tracking virtual events (especially Irish ones) from August onwards. Do
  let us know if we are missing an event, workshop, conferences as well as opportunities,
  grants, etc.

title: Live Blog Part 3 - Virtual Tech Events during Covid-19

<div class="alert alert-info">
ℹ️ NOTE: This post is not updated anymore so it doesn't get too long (and arduous to maintain), check the <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/">for the latest new live blog</a> for the current month.
</div>


You can find archives of previous virtual events at: <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/covid-19-and-changes-how-tech-communities-handle-events-and-conferences-2020-3-14">March to June</a> | <a href="https://codinggrace.com/news/live-blog-part-2-virtual-tech-events-during-covid-19-2020-6-1/">July</a>

I'll keep track of virtual tech events from August onwards here. This seems to be a norm, so to a point where this live blog is not needed anymore, I'll stop, and will just have them in our monthly Coding Grace newsletter. (Also helps me so I don't double up on the work maintaining the lists on a blog and newsletter).


Let me know either via <a href="mailto:contact@codinggrace.com">contact@codinggrace.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/codinggrace">@CodingGrace</a> if you want to include:-

* a missing upcoming event
* announcements
* call to actions / help
* opportunities / grants 

Here's some events and conferences who have adapted to having their events virtually (I'll try and keep this post updated).

# 🌈 Finally

As our Taoiseach said in [his statement](https://www.gov.ie/en/speech/5a280b-statement-by-an-taoiseach-on-measures-to-tackle-covid-19-washington/) on Thursday (Mar 12th):

<blockquote class="blockquote">
 "I know that some of this is coming as a real shock and it is going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives. [...] We’re doing it for each other. Together, we can slow the virus in its tracks and push it back. Acting together, as one nation, we can save many lives."
</blockquote>

Let's do our part and make sure help slow down the spread of the virus and protect our community and all those loved ones around us. ❤️

# 🗄 Past virtual events since last post - 
#### 🆙 Moved to the end, as this ARCHIVED events list is getting really long! 😆

I've decided to add this section as it might be helpful for others who are looking into running virtual events, and share ideas used.
