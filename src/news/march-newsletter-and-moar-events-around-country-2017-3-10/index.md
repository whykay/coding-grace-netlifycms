With Internationals Women's Day (March 8th) just gone, there's still plenty more diversity-friendly in tech events happening this month. Ah sure, let's make it International Women's Day Month!!! :-)

I'll be at Career Zoo tomorrow and I'm so happy to work on the Allies workshops which is free for Career Zoo attendees, we have:-

* Networking for your Career
* Unconscious Bias by NWCI
* Imposter Syndrome by Pauline Sargent, Digiwomen

There's Overcoming Barriers for Women in STEM diversity panel, and I am looking forward to Intertech Ireland who'll talking about diversity in the workplace entitled "Diversity is Dead" with Laura Harmon (NWCI). Here's the description of the panel:

  > How can corporations overcome the challenge of adopting diversity as a core value – as opposed to a buzzword? Does business have a responsibility to create initiatives internally to make its more diverse employees feel more comfortable? Are such initiatives (where they exist at all) ever anything more than lip service?
  >
  > Join another lively discussion with InterTech Ireland – Ireland’s diversity forum for tech.
