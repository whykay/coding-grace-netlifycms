Congratulations to **VELDA CONATY** for winning a free ticket to [devitconf.org](http://devitconf.org) which will be held in Greece (Sat 20 - Sun 21 May), and huge thanks to Simona Cotin (who’s MC’ing at devit) for offering this opportunity.

A couple of reasons to go to devit:

* the conf organizers have put a huge effort in making sure they have a  diverse lineup => 50% of their conference speakers are women
* the conference lineup covers 360 in terms of topics with international speakers (all talks will be in english)

Bonus: super friendly people, good weather in may, delicious food

*Note: Yip, I wrote a quick Python script to pick a winner from the registered csv file. :-)*

# Notes from the panel discussions 
I didn't take notes till half way through panel, if anyone else have notes to share, please do so in the comments, thanks in advance.

### How can I suggest tech interviews to be conducted in a format I’m more comfortable in e.g. whiteboard, coding on laptop, etc.

* Get practice in:-
	* [https://codility.com/programmers/](https://codility.com/programmers/)
	* [https://codeeval.com](https://codeeval.com)
* Be open & communicate in interviews. And flexible but be aware that you are going to be in that environment. Just mention that you are uncomfortable.

### What are the most important criteria in evaluating young candidates for a tech role in your company? What qualities do you consider essential to have in the long run?

* Curiosity; prob solving; open mind
* Passionate; prob solving
* Articulate, passion, drive, motivation over phone
* Not a jerk; fine line between arrogant and passionate
* Good interviewer recognise someone's skillset 
* Communication skills

### Self taught v tech school
Some companies do look at formal third level educations and require 1.1, however, times are changing, job spec should be updated from option of years equiv experience to a degree.

### How to break into the tech scene as a female developer with little coding experience.
* Networking (internal & external)
* Open source projects
* Hackathons
* Go to events

### Top Tips
* Find a way to get a cv internally to avoid hr keyword search
* Apply for lots of jobs 
* Networking 
* Don't assume know everything (especially on job spec)
* Job spec may not be up to date; apply anyway. You might have something on your cv they might like.
* Interviewers are not there to catch you out.
* Don't be afraid; get a mentor, talk to friends
* No one talks about imposter syndrome, talk about it. 
* Be part of the community.
* Be deliberate & selfish and who you associate your name with.
* Join Linkedin.

## Side-note: Imposter syndrome
[Imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) has been mentioned. Let us know if you want us to run a workshop on imposter syndrome.

I would recommend contacting Pauline Sargent (Digiwomen) who have a lot of experience with imposter syndrome workshops and discussion around this topic. 

Here's a great video about imposter syndrome:
