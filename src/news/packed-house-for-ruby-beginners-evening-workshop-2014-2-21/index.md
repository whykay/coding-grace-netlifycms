<p>It was certainly full of people who are dipping their toes into Ruby. After a quick introduction about Coding Grace and the person the organisation is named after, Grace Hopper, we went straight into writing their first Ruby script.</p>

<p>After some initial setups and wee setbacks from the local Wi-Fi (or lack of), everyone was set up with Ruby set up and exercise files to work on afterwards.</p>
<p>There workshop went pretty swiftly covering numbers, text, variables, Booleans, flow control, arrays, hashes to writing one&#8217;s own Ruby piece of code and experimenting by running it.</p>
<p>After running through the slides with everyone trying out scripts in their <em>irb,</em> people grouped up to go through exercises together.</p>
<p><span>Ruby workshop setup and exercise files: </span><a href="http://bit.ly/cg-ruby-feb14">http://bit.ly/cg-ruby-feb14</a></p>
<p>A few things that I noted from the workshop from questions asked:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://tryruby.org">tryruby.org</a>: Try out Ruby commands in your browser</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/">ruby-lang.org/en/documentation</a>: Ruby documentation</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublimetext.com</a>: Sublime Tex Editor (Recommended)</li>
<li>Sorting characters in Ruby. Uppercase letters come before lowercase letters.<br/>- <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html#method-i-3C-3D-3E">http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html#method-i-3C-3D-3E<br/></a>- <a href="http://www.evc-cit.info/cit020/beginning-programming/chp_07/custom_sort.html">http://www.evc-cit.info/cit020/beginning-programming/chp_07/custom_sort.html</a></li>
</ul><p>Also how we refer to symbols used in Ruby (and most coding languages)</p>
<ul><li><strong>[</strong> or <strong>]</strong> - Square brackets</li>
<li><strong>(</strong> or <strong>)</strong> - Parenthesis </li>
<li><strong>{</strong> or <strong>}</strong> - Curly brackets or braces</li>
<li><strong>!</strong> - Not</li>
</ul><p><span>Basic command lines:</span></p>
<ul><li><span><strong>ls</strong> (Linux) or <strong>dir</strong> (for windows)- List contents in the directory  </span></li>
<li><strong><span>cd</span></strong><span> <em>name_of_dir </em>- Change directory to <em>name_of_dir</em></span></li>
</ul><p><span>Here&#8217;s a handy <a href="http://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf" title="Linux/Unix command line cheatsheet">cheatsheet</a> for *nix commands when you use command line in your chosen terminal/console.</span></p>
