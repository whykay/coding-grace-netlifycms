title: Coding Grace at Hopper Local Dublin demoing MicroPython on Micro:Bit and CircuitPython
  on Circuit Playground Express
---

As with all good (in this case, fantastic) things, it started off in a very small way.

The ever amazing [Stephen Howell](https://twitter.com/saorog) invited me to be involved in an event called Grace Hopper Local held in Dublin later this month. 

If you haven't heard of Grace Hopper Celebrations (GHC), it "is the world's largest gathering of women technologists.", and if you are curious, their upcoming conference is in Orlando, Florida in Oct 2-4. They had 20,000+ attendees from 78 countries ([read their 2018 impact report here](https://ghc.anitab.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/ghc-18-impact-report.pdf)).

Back to the Dublin event, it's a 1-day locally organised conference modelled after GHC. Besides being the inaugural event, they will be launching the AnitaB.org local community as well! It's in partnership with Anita B.org, and is sponsored by Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Stripe, SFI, Allstate, Mastercard and SAP.

My involvement is being part of the "Maker Workshop on Wearables" and will be demoing [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) on the [Micro:Bit](https://microbit.org/).

This gets better, I tweeted what I'll be doing:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to demo <a href="https://twitter.com/micropython?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@micropython</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/microbit_edu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@microbit_edu</a> at the upcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HopperLocalDublin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HopperLocalDublin</a> celebration of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/womenintech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#womenintech</a>. Read about the keynote &amp; other featured speakers: <a href="https://t.co/ftFYHC6cj6">https://t.co/ftFYHC6cj6</a>. Have you registered for this inspiring 1-day event modelled after <a href="https://twitter.com/ghc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ghc</a>? <a href="https://t.co/hGd2W4uiQw">pic.twitter.com/hGd2W4uiQw</a></p>&mdash; whykay üë©üèª‚Äçüíªüêàüåà (@whykay) <a href="https://twitter.com/whykay/status/1095312067832303616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2019</a></blockquote>


Next thing was quite unexpected:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">if ya want any circuitpython hardware to use/demo, let us know, we can send out some - <a href="https://t.co/ZJGqMPwGDE">https://t.co/ZJGqMPwGDE</a> &amp; <a href="https://t.co/SADDSfraKg">https://t.co/SADDSfraKg</a></p>&mdash; adafruit industries (@adafruit) <a href="https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1095342727451955201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2019</a></blockquote>

After gathering my bearings, I put on my organiser hat as I know ordering and deliveries on a tight turnaround and politely turned them down:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thx, the event is on Feb 27, so it‚Äôs a bit tight plus as it‚Äôs delivering from US to Ireland, there might be a customs charge that I may/may not get stung for. I‚Äôve some bits &amp; bobs here &amp; if I‚Äôve time, I‚Äôll demo CircuitPython, but def will shout out about it and yourselves! 1/2</p>&mdash; whykay üë©üèª‚Äçüíªüêàüåà (@whykay) <a href="https://twitter.com/whykay/status/1095368297929936897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2019</a></blockquote>


And then my fan-girling came out because I do follow [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), and tell folks at various maker workshops about them and their amazing founder, [Limor (Fried)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limor_Fried) aka ladyada:-

Then this tweet happened, and I went ü§Ø

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">yay! all good, we can get anything shipped to anywhere without snags, when yer&#39; ready for any hardware to be sent, let us know! (email limor@adafruit ...</p>&mdash; adafruit industries (@adafruit) <a href="https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1095370923476164608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2019</a></blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The world did slow down for me, before I gathered my jaw off the ground and followed up with Limor Fried via email, I explained I'm quite new demoing electronics and not sure what to choose with regards Adafruit components to demo with [CircuitPython](https://www.adafruit.com/circuitpython). In my head, I'm going... "Omgerd, I have to demo CircuitPython! üò±". I was lucky enough that [Mick](https://twitter.com/micktwomey) got us a couple of [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333), so I mentioned that. And what came next made me pick up my jaw off the ground (again), she offered to send me along [Circuit Playground Express Advanced Pack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2769). That was so super generous as well as being so supportive of what we are doing. 

And now I have no excuse to demo it outside of Hopper Local Dublin, therefore I'm aiming to give a demo/talk at [PyLadies Dublin](https://dublin.pyladies.com) in April or May this year. I realised I haven't been giving many tech talks at it, so "walk the walk, Vicky! üòä". 

Now that amazing gift is on-route, I'm back to planning the extra content for my demo at Hopper Local Dublin Conference later this month.
