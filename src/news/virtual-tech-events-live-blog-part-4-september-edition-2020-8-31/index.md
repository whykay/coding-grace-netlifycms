short_description: I've been keeping track of virtual tech events (especially Irish-based
  ones) since the lockdown back in March. This is for September events onwards. Do
  let us know if we are missing an event, workshop, conferences as well as opportunities,
  grants, etc.

<div class="alert alert-info">
ℹ️ NOTE: This post is not updated anymore so it doesn't get too long (and arduous to maintain), check the <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/">for the latest new live blog</a> for the current month.
</div>


You can find archives of previous virtual events at: <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/covid-19-and-changes-how-tech-communities-handle-events-and-conferences-2020-3-14">March to June</a> | <a href="https://codinggrace.com/news/live-blog-part-2-virtual-tech-events-during-covid-19-2020-6-1/">July</a> | <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/live-blog-part-3-virtual-tech-events-during-covid-19-2020-7-31/">August</a>

I'll keep track of virtual tech events from September onwards here. This seems to be a norm, so to a point where this live blog is not needed anymore, I'll stop, and will just have them in our monthly Coding Grace newsletter. (Also helps me so I don't double up on the work maintaining the lists on a blog and newsletter).


Let me know either via <a href="mailto:contact@codinggrace.com">contact@codinggrace.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/codinggrace">@CodingGrace</a> if you want to include:-

* a missing upcoming event
* announcements
* call to actions / help
* opportunities / grants 

Here's some events and conferences who have adapted to having their events virtually (I'll try and keep this post updated).
