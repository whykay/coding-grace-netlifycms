Setup was required in the morning, it was my bad, I thought everything would be conducted via a shared iPython Notebook, but it wasn't too bad. Installing [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) works for both Windows and MacOSX. After installing, one just has to search for "iPython Notebook browser" and it launches the browser ready for you to create a new notebook.

Kevin's notes and iPython Notebooks can be found in his [Github repository](https://github.com/DragonflyStats/PythonDataAnalysis).
