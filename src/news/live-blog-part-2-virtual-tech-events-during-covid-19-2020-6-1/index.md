short_description: The original live blog was getting very long, so I archived it,
  and created one for June virtual events onwards.

<div class="alert alert-info">
ℹ️ NOTE: This post is not updated anymore so it doesn't get too long (and arduous to maintain), check the <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/">for the latest new live blog</a> for the current month.
</div>

I've archived the other <a href="https://www.codinggrace.com/news/covid-19-and-changes-how-tech-communities-handle-events-and-conferences-2020-3-14/#opportunities">live blog</a> of past virtual events, and for the month of June onwards, I'll keep track of virtual tech events. This seems to be a norm, so to a point where this live blog is not needed anymore, I'll stop, and will just have them in our monthly Coding Grace newsletter. (Also helps me so I don't double up on the work maintaining the lists on a blog and newsletter).

Let me know either via <a href="mailto:contact@codinggrace.com">contact@codinggrace.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/codinggrace">@CodingGrace</a> if you want to include:-

* a missing upcoming event
* announcements
* call to actions / help
* opportunities / grants 

Here's some events and conferences who have adapted to having their events virtually (I'll try and keep this post updated).

# 🌈 Finally

As our Taoiseach said in [his statement](https://www.gov.ie/en/speech/5a280b-statement-by-an-taoiseach-on-measures-to-tackle-covid-19-washington/) on Thursday (Mar 12th):

<blockquote class="blockquote">
 "I know that some of this is coming as a real shock and it is going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives. [...] We’re doing it for each other. Together, we can slow the virus in its tracks and push it back. Acting together, as one nation, we can save many lives."
</blockquote>

Let's do our part and make sure help slow down the spread of the virus and protect our community and all those loved ones around us. ❤️
