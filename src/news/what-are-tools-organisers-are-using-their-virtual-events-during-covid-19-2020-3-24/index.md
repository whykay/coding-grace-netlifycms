short_description: My previous blog post is a live listings of events (especially
  Irish ones), but as I was checking what they are using, I decided to collate them
  in a table, and Zoom followed by Youtube channels are the most popular so far.

My [previous blog post](https://www.codinggrace.com/news/covid-19-and-changes-how-tech-communities-handle-events-and-conferences-2020-3-14/) is a live listings of events (especially Irish ones), but as I was checking what they are using, I decided to collate them in a table, and Zoom followed by Youtube channels are the most popular so far.

Hopefully this is useful for some folks.
