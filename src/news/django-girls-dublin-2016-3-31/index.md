We are delighted to be a partner for Django Girls Dublin, their booked out upcoming workshop in April looks pretty exciting. And a big shout out to coaches who volunteered on the day day.

The demand was high and we had to close the applications early and there's enough folks on the waiting list for us to consider a second Django Girls Dublin, which is amazing. So keep your eyes and ears open for later this year.

I won't be there on the day, but I'm helping Paula where I can logistically behind the scenes, e.g. PSF grant proposal, stickers, t-shirts, posters, call for coaches, etc. It's actually a really big undertaking, and fingers crossed it will get easier next time as we have things in place.

There's more exciting news coming soon, and I'll post more updates.

In the meantime, hop over to the [Django Girls Dublin website](https://djangogirls.org/dublin/) for more info like who our coaches are.
