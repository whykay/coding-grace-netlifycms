A wee update to say thank you again to [Kats Conf](http://www.katsconf.com/) and everyone involved in bringing such a great conference to the community. The support of Caroline and Aoife from [Workday](https://www.workday.com/) has been amazing for hosting our Allyship workshop.

The big thing I want to say out loud is the amazing contribution from Kats Conf,  around **EUR3000** has been donated to Coding Grace, and we canâ€™t say how much we appreciate it. 

This will contribute to:-

* Run more workshops.
* Support other Coding Grace chapters, we have one in [Limerick](http://www.codinggrace.com/chapters/Limerick/) and [Wexford](http://www.codinggrace.com/chapters/Wexford/) now.
* Pay for our accountant.
* Maybe get more stickers and buttons to spread word of Coding Grace far and wide. ðŸ˜¸

There are a few ways of getting involved with us:-

* Starting a chapter in your local area
* Idea to run a workshop
* Mentor - [register your interest here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12XbtEtgY_V1quYNgD3SHMPcXB2kDiNHzRl7FvVIaISc/viewform?usp=send_form)
* Sponsoring and/or hosting our workshops

If you are interested, you can email us via <a href="mailto:contact@codinggrace.com">contact@codinggrace.com</a>.

Don't forget to check out [Functional Kubs](https://www.meetup.com/FunctionalKubs/) on their upcoming Kata evenings, whom some were organisers of Kats Conf 2 this year.
