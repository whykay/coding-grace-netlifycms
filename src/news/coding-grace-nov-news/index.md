It has been awhile. and by the way, [our Django workshop hosted by Overstock in Sligo](https://codinggrace.com/events/coding-workshop-sligo/2022/) went well, here's a [write-up](https://dev.to/codinggrace/django-sligo-workshop-4bkn) on it.

As many know there's been lots of changes in Twitter and one of the services, Revue, will be sunsetted soon. And we have been using that as our newsletter platform, because of this news, we are moving to Substack: [codinggrace.substack.com](https://codinggrace.substack.com/)
