short_description: A Happy New Year to all! With news of vaccinations happening right
  now (albeit slowly) and increase of R number in Ireland (and many other countries),
  it looks like we will have virtual events for the next while. So I'll maintain Irish
  virtual tech events here and will keep doing so. Share you event with us if we are
  missing one. Stay safe!

I'll keep track of virtual tech events here to a point where this live blog is not needed anymore, I'll stop, and will just have them in our monthly Coding Grace newsletter. (Also helps me so I don't double up on the work maintaining the lists on a blog and newsletter).


Let me know either via <a href="mailto:contact@codinggrace.com">contact@codinggrace.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/codinggrace">@CodingGrace</a> if you want to include:-

* a missing upcoming event
* announcements
* call to actions / help
* opportunities / grants 

Here's some events and conferences who have adapted to having their events virtually (I'll try and keep this post updated).
