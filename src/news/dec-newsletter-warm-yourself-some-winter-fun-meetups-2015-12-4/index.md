### BIG TECHIE TABLE QUIZ
Now I got your attention, a bunch of us community organisers came together and created a charity table quiz and bring as many people from the community together and have some fun under one roof! There's prizes to be won, and it's a great way to find out about other user groups. And it's **FREE** and there will be snacks and beverages. It's all for a good cause, so the more the merrier. **[RSVP here for some merry fun!](https://ti.to/irishgeeks/the-night-before-quizmas)**
