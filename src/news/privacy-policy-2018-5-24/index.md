### We respect your personal data and privacy.

Our staff will erase your data from all files, database records and backups. You will be informed at the end of the process. Information cannot be restored afterwards.

The only exception to data wiping is invoices: if you have bought something on our website, we are legally required to preserve the invoices for 5 years after the emission.
