title: Talking about the Coding Community at The Liquor Rooms Salon Series

That was an experience and a lot of fun (aside from the mic-wrestling) having talks alongside [Michael](https://twitter.com/micktwomey) and [Irina](https://twitter.com/strawbana) as part of The Liquor Rooms Salon Series. Topic was about "Coding". I talked about my involvement with the community with an audience who is mostly not in tech, which is a nice change. 

Irina told us a story on how she went through various PR jobs whilst avoiding to become a journalist, the meeting of a the wierd Scottish guy who created Kanban and ended up being her boss to promote Kanban to her being the Editor of the [Dublin Globe](http://www.dublinglobe.com/). She also runs the [Dublin Lean Coffee Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Lean-Coffee-Meetup/). 

Mick talked about how he likes tinkering with wee computers like the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), and how he ran around trying to get people to listen to two black holes colliding (I remember that game jam day clearly, and it was cool, [check out LIGO for more info](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/educational-resources)), briefly taking us on a journey of when he got into coding and move from [Python](https://www.python.org/) to [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) promgramming language, and showing his [MicroBit](https://www.microbit.co.uk/) to the audience. The remote wasn't working too well during the presentations, so he didn't do a demo.

It was followed by a panel discussion which was fun, ranging from Irina giving her short explanation of what Kanban is to advice to novice beginners of coding to advice about a venue for people to hangout that is not a bar.

A huge thanks to Chandrika for inviting me to give a talk about what I do, and extending the message to people outside of the tech circle, I would highly recommend checking out the rest of their Salon Series via [http://www.theliquorrooms.com/calendar/](http://www.theliquorrooms.com/calendar/). I'm looking forward to the Comics Lab next Tuesday (9th). ðŸ˜¬
