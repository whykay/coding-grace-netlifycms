short_description: Our June newsletter just went out recently, and since then, I still
  come across events and other news. So here's the write-up that I keep up-to-date
  on events I come across, and you are free to contribute in the comments also.

This blog post is a follow up events that I come across since the June newsletter was published. If you see anything or want to share something of interest, e.g. events, workshops, conferences, ticket discounts, grants and scholarships; please share in the comments below.


Also, I recommend listening to the following podcast which features my friend Naomi Freeman, and she's talking about a book she co-wrote with Coraline Ada called The Compassionate Coder. [Listen to podcast via Pursuit Podcast >>>](http://hyperurl.co/pursuitpod)

And a reminder to anyone heading to Inspirefest, I'll be there and I'll have stickers with me if anyone wants to do a sticker swap, I also have these shiney ones that I got for [LoveLaceSpace](http://www.lovelacespace.com/)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here‚Äôs a vid of the <a href="https://twitter.com/LovelaceSpace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LovelaceSpace</a> sticker. Told you it‚Äôs shiney. üò¨ <a href="https://t.co/jbe3xYXETe">https://t.co/jbe3xYXETe</a> <a href="https://t.co/PAylTxEngF">pic.twitter.com/PAylTxEngF</a></p>&mdash; whykay (@whykay) <a href="https://twitter.com/whykay/status/988469255447474176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2018</a></blockquote>

So wave me down and say "hi!" and/or swap stickers with me, or take one. üåà
