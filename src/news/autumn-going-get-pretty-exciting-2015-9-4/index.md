There's a few things happening the next month or two, and they are all pretty exciting.

We will be partnering with [CoderDojoGirls](https://twitter.com/CoderDojoGirls), [Girls Hack Ireland](https://twitter.com/GirlsHackIE) to run an exciting coding event at DCU Innovation Campus on Saturday, October 10th.

What's cool it's part of two major celebrations

* [International Day of the Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_the_Girl_Child)
* [EU Code Week](http://codeweek.eu/)

I'll also be at the upcoming [Career Zoo](http://www.careerzoo.ie/) and the event has a big focus on Women in Tech, there's a series of workshops as part of the [MiNT initative](https://mint.idirus.com/).
