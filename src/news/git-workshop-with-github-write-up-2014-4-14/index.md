After everyone settled down (a few got a wee bit lost finding the venue, but got here safe and sound). One thing I noticed that maybe there would be a need to run another basic command line workshop. For those interested, I ran one recently and here's [the write-up](http://www.codinggrace.com/chapters/ireland/dublin/posts/2014-03-30-command-line-demystified/) about it.

The mentors went around helping with people having problems with machines or the just general Git queries, but mostly everyone followed the workshop.

After a short break, we start to get even more interactive with the hellogitworld repository from <https://github.com/githubteacher?tab=repositories>.

All in all, it was a fun and interesting experience. It was a first of many for participants, mentors and myself in collaborating with a trainer virtually.

And finally, a big thanks to those who came along and learnt about Git.
