<p>Our third workshop complete and everyone had a day learning&nbsp;<span>about HTML and CSS. A 4-hour session at a nice pace suited both instructors and the people attending the workshop.</span></p>
<p><img alt="HTML5 and CSS3 Beginner's workshop complete." class="medal" src="http://media.tumblr.com/ef3f116a4c5a71a49e03e4422fea18bb/tumblr_inline_msgqmuZb2H1qz4rgp.png" />Starting on time, after a brief introduction and with most people who were <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wuho9s1xtra1jC0RII7XPbdkzZhG8yiurGzT97VGdqA/edit" title="Setup requirements for the workshop">set up</a>&nbsp;prior to the workshop, we had enough mentors to go around help anyone who had problems.</p>
<p>With knowledge of basic HTML5 from a well-paced <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ow20LSm6rEjwPcDitep_i5p56cOAsdMq0bUnBmyMJHs/edit#slide=id.ge5243f3a_0157" title="Intro to HTML5 by Caitriona Dwyer">Lesson 1</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/CaitrionaDwyer" title="Caitriona on Twitter">Caitriona Dwyer</a>, we showed the source of the <a href="denied:view-source:http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" title="First webpage">very first webpage by Tim Berners-Lee</a>, and it's a <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2013/04/the-very-first-website-returns-to-the-web/" title="1992 copy of first webpage - article">1992 copy of it</a>, and so far is the oldest copy after our break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onto <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ow20LSm6rEjwPcDitep_i5p56cOAsdMq0bUnBmyMJHs/edit#slide=id.gfb460ef1_04" title="Intro to CSS3 by Caitriona Dwyer">Lesson 2</a>&nbsp;(Caitriona), which is introduction to CSS3, this is where people's sample webpage starts to look interesting. Mentors milling around helping and answering questions, it was a hive of activity and before we knew it was time for lunch.</p>
<p>A short lunch break (thanks to everyone who tried to help clear the pastries), we delved into a little bit <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ow20LSm6rEjwPcDitep_i5p56cOAsdMq0bUnBmyMJHs/edit#slide=id.ge5243f3a_010" title="Lesson 3 - More about CSS3 by Stephanie Francis">more about CSS3</a>&nbsp;given by <a href="http://twitter.com/cloudsteph" title="Stephanie on Twitter">Stephanie Francis</a>. The last and final exercise was again, a total free reign on trying out all the various properties with the help of the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/codinggrace/introduction-to-html-css-workshop/src/1a77c901af33d2ed2a4513828926c5611e5a1283/04-ex3cheatsheet-cssproperties.pdf?at=default" title="Lesson 3 Cheatsheet.">cheatsheet</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone that came along on Saturday morning for 9AM, given for those who used public transport were at the mercy of Dublin Bus and DARTs that early on a weekend, we all made it in.</p>
<p>Again, thanks to Caitriona and Stephanie for doing up the slides, cheatsheets and exercises. Thanks to the Alan, Ursula, Mick for helping out on the day.</p>
<p>A <strong>big thanks</strong> to Web Summit for hosting our event.</p>

<p>One final thing, there has been enquiries about more HTML &amp; CSS workshops, so keep the requests coming so I know how many are interested. We certainly have instructors to help out.</p>
