---

As we have heard by now from the news and media of Paddy Cosgrave and Web Summit inviting far-right leader Marine Le Pen to Web Summit 2018*. He penned a Medium post (which I won’t link here or to other tweets about it) on his decision why. 

_* Update: The invitation has since rescinded_

Coding Grace are disappointed with Paddy Cosgrave and Web Summit who offered to provide a platform for fascism, and increasing its visibility and legitimacy of their views. Freedom of speech is a right but it’s the organisers who ultimately decide who to host on stage in front of a global audience.

Until further notice, we will not be supporting or engaging with any of the events by Web Summit who offered to provide a platform for hate, racism and xenophobia which goes against our own [Code of Conduct][1] in regards to being inclusive and diverse.
