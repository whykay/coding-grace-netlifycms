It was a great turn out for the workshop, and  surprisingly even with the sunny weather.

Big thank you to [Insight Centre Data for Analytics (DCU)](https://www.insight-centre.org/content/dublin-city-university) for hosting and providing delicious food from [The Washer Woman](https://twitter.com/thewasherwoman1). A lot of the tweets here are from Laura, so thanks for tweeting about the day.

Following my introduction, Kevin took over and made sure people are all set up. We pointed people to go to [bit.ly/PyDataWorkshop](https://bit.ly/PyDataWorkshop) and since folks didn't have problems with installing Anaconda, folks went straight into section **1) Using IPython / Jupyter Notebooks**. People learnt [how to set up their enviroment, and where to get datasets and load it into Jupyter](https://pythondatalab.wordpress.com/getting-data/) followed by demos on some of the tools and [coding conventions](https://pythondatalab.wordpress.com/essentials/) used to analyse the data. Kevin mentioned the [PIMA Indians Diabetes data](https://pythondatalab.wordpress.com/getting-data/pima/) as well (via "Getting data" in the menu of [https://bit.ly/PyDataWorkshop](https://bit.ly/PyDataWorkshop)) for people to use and try some of the functionality shown earlier.

And here's the fare for lunchtime!

After the yummy lunch, folks continued with content from **1) Using IPython / Jupyter Notebooks**.

I've also [storified the day from all the nice tweets from folks](https://storify.com/whykay/data-analysis-with-python-workshop-insight-dcu), thanks to all who tweeted and took pictures.

If you have pictures and you are on Flickr, you can share your pictures with the Coding Grace photo pool: [https://www.flickr.com/groups/codinggrace](https://www.flickr.com/groups/codinggrace).
