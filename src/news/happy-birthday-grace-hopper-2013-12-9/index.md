<p>As most people have seen today if they opened Google search page, you are presented with a Google Doodle celebrating Rear Admiral Grace Hopper birthday today. If she was alive, she would be 107 today.</p>
<p>If you haven't see the Google Doodle, here's the image, or just head to <a href="http://google.ie">google.ie</a>.</p>

<p>I didn't realise she was on the David Letterman show until I saw it via many news sites about today's Google Doodle. Check it out!</p>

<p>It was also nice of Silicon Republic giving us <a href="http://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/item/35099-wit2013/" title="Animated Google Doodle computes the 107th birthday of Grace Murray Hopper">a wee shout</a> as well in their article today.</p>
<p>It's fantastic seeing Grace Hopper honoured in so many news and tech sites, and remembered in such a nice way (thanks, Google).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Birthday from all of us, and we are glad we have you as our role model.</p>
