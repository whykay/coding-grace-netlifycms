# 🧑‍🎄 "Tis the season to be jolly!“ ⛄️

🙌 Yip, our newsletter is out and it's the final one of this year and I'm pretty happy with the transition from Mailchimp to using Revue. What do you think? 🤔

📢 If you have any events, CFPs, opportunities like grants and other announcements, you can email [contact@codinggrace.com](mailto:contact@codinggrace.com) and we will include it in our next newsletter. They are normally published at the beginning of each month.

🚨 Help us spread the word and get more subscribers as well as telling us what else you want on the newsletter. Thanks in advance.

Following are more announcements and reminders and I'll try and update if anything else pop up for this month.

This could be your chance to bring change! ✔️✔️
WAI and AI Sweden are launching a survey to find out what women in AI want from their workplace with our WAI@WORK survey.

## Enough Already: Break the Cycles of Abuse in Gaming (Feminist Frequency)
> Every time a news story breaks about toxicity and abuse at a high-profile game company, or harassment by someone in a position of power, we see an uptick in calls to the Games and Online Harassment Hotline. Statements and promises are always made, but like clockwork, wait six months and the same problem resurfaces.
