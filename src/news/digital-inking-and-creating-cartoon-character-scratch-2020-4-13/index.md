Hope everyone is keeping well, I recently got back to drawing, and wanted to properly use the iPad for the digital painting. So I followed the 21 Draw masterclass using Procreate on iPad. It was a 1 hour workshop, it took me nearly 5 hours.

Note that I haven't been drawing for awhile, especially creating something from scratch. I've always wanted to make something with one of the many art apps on my iPad. So my opportunity arises with this masterclass to [draw a cartoon character from start to finish](https://www.21-draw.com/course/draw-cartoon-character/). BTW, I'm not endorsed by 21 Draw, I am a huge fan, one of their kickstarter backers. ðŸ˜Š

Started with rough sketch with reference (it's ok to use ref pics ðŸ™Œ), although I hate drawing hands... took me awhile to get it okay looking.

More inking... Now getting outline, and needed a t-shirt reference

It's certainly a lot of fun, and looking into more refinement in drawing clothes. And of course, drawing hands need more practice.
