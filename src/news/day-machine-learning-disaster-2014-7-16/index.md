I would like to thank [Phil Trelford](https://twitter.com/ptrelford) for being a great teacher, and [Andrea Magnorsky](https://twitter.com/roundcrisis) for helping out on the day.

Also a very big thank you to **Microsoft Ireland** for hosting our workshop.

Of course a shout out to **[fsharpWorks]( http://fsharpworks.com/)** for bring Phil all the way over from London for the day.

And finally to all those who came along, without you, the workshop wouldn't have been possible.
